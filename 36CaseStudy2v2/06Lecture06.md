# 🖥️ **Virtual Machines: Simplifying Code Deployment Across Platforms**
Before diving back into system design, let’s understand **Virtual Machines (VMs)** — a concept that helps us create a **resilient and flexible architecture**.

## 🚀 **Why Do We Need VMs?**
When we deploy code to a server (a machine connected to the internet), the code must **run on the machine’s OS**. However, our code may be platform-dependent:
* **File System Differences:** Windows OS is case-insensitive for file names, while Linux is case-sensitive.
* **Executable Format Differences:** Windows uses `.exe`, macOS uses `.dmg`, and Linux often uses ELF binaries.

This **platform dependence** creates deployment challenges when our development and production environments run different OSes.

## 🏗️ **Two Approaches to Run Multiple OSes on One Machine**
### 1️⃣ **Dual Boot (Multi-Boot):**
* Partition hardware into segments, each with its own OS.
* At startup, choose which OS to boot.
* **Limitation:** Can only run one OS at a time.

### 2️⃣ **Virtualization (Using Hypervisor):**
* **Host OS** runs directly on hardware.
* Install a **hypervisor** (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) on the Host OS.
* The hypervisor creates **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
    * Each VM acts as a **virtual hardware environment**.
    * On each VM, install a **Guest OS** (with its own libraries and system calls).
    * The hypervisor **isolates and manages** VMs, making each feel like it’s running on a separate physical machine.

💡 This allows us to run **platform-specific code** in a virtualized environment that mimics the target OS.

## 🧩 **But Wait – Isn’t This Complex?**
While VMs solve platform issues, they introduce complexity:
* **Resource Heavy:** Each VM runs a full OS, consuming significant CPU, memory, and storage.
* **Performance Impact:** Virtualization adds overhead since the hypervisor brokers every interaction between hardware and the guest OS.

## 🧱 **What’s the Better Solution? Containers!**
To avoid the complexity of full VMs, we use **containerization**. Containers:
- Share the Host OS kernel while isolating code and dependencies.
- Are lightweight, faster, and consume fewer resources than VMs.
- Make deployment easier and more portable.
