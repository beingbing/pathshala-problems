# ⚙️ **Asynchronous Processing – Simplified**

## 🚦 **Why Switch to Asynchronous Processing?**
In **synchronous systems**, the client sends a request and waits (blocking) until the server finishes processing.
- ❌ This **blocks the client**, causing delays and poor user experience (e.g., app looks frozen).

With **asynchronous processing**, the system:
* ✅ **Acknowledges the request immediately** without waiting for full processing.
* ✅ **Decouples the client response** from heavy backend tasks.

## 🔄 **How Asynchronous Processing Works**
- **Client sends request** →
- **Server acknowledges receipt** and saves the request in the **database** with status `'INIT'`.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** detects this new record and triggers an event.
- The request is **pushed into a Message Broker** (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) – a queue of tasks.
- **Worker threads** (runners) pick tasks from the broker and process them **in parallel**.
- When done, **Worker updates the DB** with status `'DONE'`.
- CDC detects this status change and triggers another event.
- **Processed result is pushed back to the broker**, from where it can be sent to the client.

## 🔁 **How Client Receives the Final Response**
There are several patterns for delivering the processed result to the client:

### 🟢 1. **Short Polling**
* Client repeatedly checks the server at short intervals for updates.
* ❌ Inefficient; generates excessive traffic.

### 🟡 2. **Long Polling**
* Client checks the server at longer intervals.
* ✅ Better than short polling, but still not ideal.

### 🔵 3. **WebSockets**
* Establishes a **persistent, bi-directional connection** between client and server.
* As soon as the result is ready, server pushes it to the client.
* ✅ Real-time updates.

### 🟠 4. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
* Server sends updates **unidirectionally** (server → client) over HTTP when results are ready.
* ✅ Lightweight and efficient for one-way notifications.

## 📤 **Bonus: WebHooks vs SSE**
* **SSE (Server-Sent Events):** Server sends updates to **clients** (browsers).
* **WebHook:** Server sends updates to **another server**, triggered by an event.

## 🔁 **Overall Flow**
```plaintext
Client → Request → Server → Acknowledges & saves to DB (status: INIT)
           ↓
        CDC triggers event → Message Broker → Worker processes request
           ↓
        Worker updates DB (status: DONE) → CDC triggers event → Broker → Worker sends response
           ↓
        Client receives response via polling, WebSocket, or SSE
```

## 🔑 **Key Takeaways**
* **Async processing decouples request and processing**, improving responsiveness and scalability.
* **Message Brokers** ensure requests are processed reliably and asynchronously.
* **Polling, WebSockets, or SSE** determine how clients get the final response.
