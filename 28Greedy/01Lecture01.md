### Greedy Algorithm
A **Greedy Algorithm** is a problem-solving strategy where decisions are made step-by-step, choosing the **locally optimal solution** at each step with the hope that this approach leads to the **global optimal solution**.

### Key Concept:
1. **Greed in Action:** Make decisions without considering future consequences, focusing only on immediate gains.

A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

### Limitations:
Not all problems can be solved using a greedy approach. If the **greedy choice property** or **optimal substructure** is not satisfied, a greedy algorithm may fail to find the global optimal solution.
