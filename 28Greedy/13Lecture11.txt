~~ Median in Running Stream - 1 ~~

given a stream of running integers, find median at any instant.

- maintain minHeap for n/2 largest items
- maintain maxHeap for n/2 smallest items

- if heaps are of different size, then heap with more elements will have root as our answer.

class MedianInStream {
    MedianInStream() {
        //
    }
    void insert(int num) {
        //
    }
    double getMedian() {
        //
    }
}
