~~ K Max in Running Stream ~~

given a stream of running integers, given k. Store k largest elements seen till any instant.

- collect k elements
- create a minHeap
- check coming element with root
- insert the bigger of two back into minHeap

TC = O(logk)
SC = O(k)

heap inherently is a greedy DS.
