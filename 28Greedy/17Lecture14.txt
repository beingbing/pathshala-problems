~~ Huffman Encoding - 1 ~~

it's one of its kind.

- assign a byte code to a character
- no code can be a prefix of another code (two code can have some chars as prefix)

- a complete byte code of a character can not be a prefix to another byte code, there can be some
common prefixes but never a complete byte code representation of a character can be a prefix to another
character representation of byte code.

implemented using binary prefix tree.

greed is -
- most frequent character - smallest length of byte code.
- least frequent character - largest length of byte code.

heap + build tree in bottom to top order greedily.
