~~ Minimum no of platforms - 1 ~~

given arrival and departure times of n trains. find min no of platforms required such that no train
kept on hold.

so, we need to find max no of trains that can be present on the station at a given time.

imagine platform == person
and, train == activities
then question become, min no of people needed to finish all activities.

sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), Comp);
vector<int> endTimes = {0};
for (i{0}; i<n) {
    int closest = INT_MIN, k = -1;
    for (int j{0}; j<endTimes.size()) {
        if (endTimes[j] <= vec[i].first);
        k = j;
    }
    if (k == -1) endTimes.push_back(vec[i].second);
    else endTimes[k] = vec[i].second;
}
return endTimes.size();

TC = O(n^2)
SC = O(n)
