~~ boolean matrix - 2 ~~

given mat[m][n] with only 0s and 1s. Transform it such that if mat[i][j] == 1 then all the cells of
ith row and jth col changed to 1 and all the diagonals that passes through i, j must also be made 1.

along a major diagonal i-j is constant
along a minor diagonal i+j is constant

rowMap lookup -> x
colMap lookup -> y
majorDiaMap lookup -> x-y
minorDiaMap lookup -> x+y

so, majorDiaMap range will be [-(n-1), n-1] transform-> [0, 2n-2] by doing x-y+(n-1)
and minorDiaMap range will be [0, 2n-2]
