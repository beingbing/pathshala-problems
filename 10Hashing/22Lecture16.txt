~~ making palindromes - 1 ~~

give a list of unique words, find all pairs of indices (i, j), i!=j such that on concatenation of
ith words with jth word the result is a palindrome.

- if prefix of a word is present in some other word as suffix
- remaining parts of both those words are palindromic

edge cases -
- empty prefix/suffix
- considering an element again
- duplicate pairs
