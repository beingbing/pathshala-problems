~~ maximum points on same line ~~

n points lying on x,y plane. find maximum number of points lying along same straight line.

for all the points lying on the same line, have the same slope.
slope = m = (y1-y)/(x1-x)



M1 -
we need a reference point (x, y) though.
so,
for each slope, we track frequency.
but this process needs to be repeated for all points.
keep track of highest frequency for each slope.
among them, highest frequency candidate will be our answer.

possible optimization -
if we have considered p1 while taking p0 as p,
then while taking p1 as p, we can leave out p0.

limitation -
rounding off of floats and doubles, e.g. - 3.9999999976, 3.9999999977
instead do pair<int, int> (y1-y, x1-x)
but here still, 4/6 and 8/12 will be considered different, which should not happen.
both should be 2/3.
for this we need to find gcd of numerator and denominator, then divide both of them by gcd.

here 0/1, 0/14, 5/0, 6/0, ... will also be taken care of, as there gcd will be 1, 14, 5, 6, ...
which after getting divided by gcd become 1,0 or 0,1

if duplicate points are present then we get (0,0), we can not let them getting divided by gcd.
for this we will keep track of duplicate points.

another problem, (2, -3) should be considered either as (-2, 3) or identical to it.
and for (-2, -3) it need to be converted to (2, 3)

so if olp (overlapping points) stores all duplicate points of p, and maxm has the maximum frequency
then total number of points will be 1(due to point p) + olp + maxm


code -

int gcd(int val1, int val2) {
    if (val1 == 0) return val2;
    if (val2 == 0) return val1;
    int mx = max(val1, val2), mn = min(val1, val2);
    if (mx%mn == 0) return mn;
    return gcd(mx%mn, mn);
}

void standardise(int& numerator, int& denominator) {
    if (numerator == 0) denominator = 1;
    else if (denominator == 0) numerator = 1;
    else if ((numerator < 0 && denominator < 0) || denominator < 0)
        numerator *= -1, denominator *= -1;
}

int maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int ans = 1;
    map<pair<int, int>, int> m;
    for (int i{0}; i<n; i++) {
        int olp = 0, maxm = 0;
        for (int j{i+1}; j<n; j++) {
            if (points[i][0] == points[j][0] && points[i][1] == points[j][1]) olp++;
            else {
                int xdiff = points[j][0] - points[i][0], ydiff = points[j][1] - points[i][1];
                int g = gcd(abs(xdiff), abs(ydiff));
                int f = xdiff/g, s = ydiff/g;
                standardise(f, s);
                m[{f,s}]++;
                maxm = max(maxm, m[{f,s}]);
            }
        }
        ans = max(ans, 1+olp+maxm);
        m.clear();
    }
    return ans;
}

TC = O(n^2 * log(maxm))
SC = O(n)
