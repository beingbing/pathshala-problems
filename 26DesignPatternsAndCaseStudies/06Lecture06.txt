~~ structure ~~

now we need to write LLD code between DB and GUI.

now, any LLD implementation has three layers -
- API layer
e.g. - writing /issueBook APi

- business class layer
e.g. - user authenticator class to verify that book issuer is a librarian.
searcher class which accepts book ID and return number of copies present in library.

- data access layer: it takes the needed data from request and query on DB.
e.g. - we get member id and search all the books issued by that member in DB.
converter class exist here which converts DAO (data access object) that we got from DB into a business object.
