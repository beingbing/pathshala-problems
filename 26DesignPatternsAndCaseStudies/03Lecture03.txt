~~ right way to approach problem ~~

LLD is all about your common sense and your perspective towards the system.

If you find an LLD problem hard then there maybe two reasons behind it -
- not sure what to make
You can forgo this problem by properly gathering concrete requirements.

- unstructured thinking
You are trying bottom-top approach to the problem. As all the individual entities wouldn't be coming along together
in desired manner.
For this you need to imply top-down approach.

How to channel our thought process in a top-down approach ?
Every system has to have a GUI component. And when we start thinking from that perspective the very first thing that comes
to our mind is how will user interaction happen.
Establish look and feel of GUI.
Establish user interaction points.
Establish data which will be traveling from UI to backend, and data needed from backend to render a UI.
Do DBMS design. Clarify entities and establish relation between them.
Then,
after doing all that, your LLD of system will be connecting your UI with your DB, which you can easily sketch out now.

The above steps will give you a functionally correct implementation. Now you do iteration over it to make it follow SOLID
design principles and refine that first rough design.
