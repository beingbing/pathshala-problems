~~ k smallest sum pairs ~~

given two sorted arrays a and b. given an integer k, find k smallest inter_array_pairs.
inter_array_pairs(x, y) : x from array a, y from array b

the DS which will be using are -
- map<pair<int, int>, bool> to track whether a pair sum is already seen or not (to avoid repetition).
- min heap of pairs (the solution will be very similar to the last problem).
