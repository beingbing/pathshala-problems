~~ Numbers with Limited Prime Factors - 2 ~~

given a primes array, find the nth natural number whose prime factorization contains prime from
given array.

in last problem we were taking out an element from min heap and were inserting its multiple on
multiplication with 2, 3 and 5. But here we will be doing just reverse, we will be keeping elements
present in primes array in min heap along with a pointer indicating till which index of answer array
we have generated a multiple.

struct Comp {
    bool operator() (pair<int, int>& p1, pair<int, int>& p2) {
        return p1.first * nums[p1.second] > p2.first * nums[p2.second];
    }
}

vector<int> nums;
priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, Comp> pq;
nums.push_back(1);
for (i{0}; i<primes.size(); i++) {
    q.push({primes[i], 0});
}
while (nums.size() < n) {
    pair<int, int> p = pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    if (p.first * nums[p.second] > nums[nums.size()-1]) {
        nums.push_back(p.first * nums[p.second]);
    }
    pq.push({p.first, p.second+1});
}
return nums[nums.size()-1];

TC = O(nlogk)
SC = O(k)
