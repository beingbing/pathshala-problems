~~ next greater permutation ~~

given an arr of n elements, find lexicographically next greater permutation.

vec<int> num
int x = num.size()-1
while (x > 0 and num[x] <= num[x-1]) x--;
if (x-1 >= 0) {
    for (y = num.size()-1; y>=x; y--) {
        if (num[y] > num[x-1]) {
            swap(num[x-1], num[y])
            break;
        }
    }
    int i = x, j = num.size()-1
    while (i < j) {
        swap(num[i], num[j])
        i++
        j--
    }
}

try generating all permutation by inputing an ascending order list and applying
above function for every result until we have the string in descending order

many libraries has this functionality in-built, and this is how exactly they are
implement.
