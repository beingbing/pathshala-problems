~~ radix sort ~~

if gap between max and min in count sort is huge then it impacts our time and space comlexity both.

always start with least significant digit.

use count sort for sorting at every level.

TC = O(d(10+n))

d = log(max) base 10/or any generic base

everything is same as you have in notes.
