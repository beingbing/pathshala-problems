~~ Space Optimised Coin Change - 2 ~~

to fill the cell of ith row, which cells are necessary. we only need that row.

i means first i elements of the input.

vector<int> ans(amount+1, 0);
ans[0] = 1;
for (i{1}; i<=coins.size(); i++) for (j{1}; j<=amount; j++) if (j>=coins[i-1]) ans[j] += ans[j-coins[i-1]];
return ans[amount];

TC = O(n^2)
SC = O(amount)
