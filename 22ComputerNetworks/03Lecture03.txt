~~ Introduction to physical layer ~~

for communication to happen between two piers, we need -
- medium. It can be either electricity or light. or, wifi/radio signals.
- form of connection -
    - guided connection (there is a physical wire that connects the two components). We do it using -
        - twisted pair cable (used in earlier days)
        - coaxial cable
        - fibre (optical) cable (mostly used nowadays)

    - unguided connection (no direct physical connection). These connections are not 100% end to end secure. We do it using -
        - Wi-Fi
        - bluetooth
    
If we are doing one way communication then it is called half-duplex connection.
whereas, if we can communicate both ways then it is called full-duplex connection.

If both the piers are of same type and understand same protocols then it is easy to establish communication between them but
what if we want to establish a communication between two heterogeneous piers ?
