~~ network delays ~~

different types of time delays associated with network transfer.

- transmission delay: converting digital to analog signal and putting it on wire. Time taken for message to be put on the medium.

- propagation delay: time taken for message to travel from source to destination on the medium.

- queuing delay: happens at destination, when received messages waits for its turn to be read in queue.

- processing delay: time taken by receiver to convert analog to digital and actually read it.

Note: propagation delay is the largest
propagation >>>> queuing > transmission ~ processing
