# TCP vs UDP – A Clear Comparison

## What Are They?
Both **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** are **transport layer protocols** in the Internet Protocol Suite. They handle how data is sent from one device to another across networks — but they work **very differently**.

## 🌐 What is TCP?

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is one of the **core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)**. It's responsible for **reliable**, **ordered**, and **error-checked delivery** of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.

> Think of TCP as the mail service that guarantees delivery, in order, and without any missing letters — even if the internet acts like a messy post office.

## ✅ TCP – Reliable, Ordered Communication

**Key Features:**
- **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection using a **three-way handshake** before sending data.
- **Reliable**: Ensures all packets reach the destination and in correct order.
- **Full-duplex**: Supports two-way communication simultaneously.
- **Error & Flow Control**: Retransmits lost packets, manages congestion, and avoids overwhelming the receiver.
- **Sequence Matters**: Packets are numbered and reassembled in order.
- **Slower**: Due to overhead of connection setup and acknowledgments.

**Use Cases:**
- Web Browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- File Transfer (FTP)
- **Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)**
- **Remote access (SSH, Telnet)**
- Any application needing guaranteed delivery

Basically, anything that needs **reliable communication** uses TCP.

## 🔁 How TCP Works: Lifecycle

### 1. 🟢 **Connection Establishment**
Uses the **Three-Way Handshake**:
- SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK

### 2. 📤 **Data Transmission**
- Data is broken into segments.
- Sequence numbers keep it ordered.
- Acknowledgments (ACKs) confirm receipt.

### 3. 🔴 **Connection Termination**
- Four-Way Handshake:
    - FIN → ACK → FIN → ACK

## 🧱 TCP Segment Structure (Header Format)

+---------------+---------------+---------------+
|  Source Port  | Destination Port              |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+
|  Sequence Number                              |

|  Checksum     | Urgent Pointer                |
+-----------------------------------------------+
|  Options (if any)                             |
+-----------------------------------------------+
|  Data (Payload)                               |
```

### ⚙️ Important Fields

- **Source/Destination Port**: Identifies apps on each side.
- **Sequence Number**: Position of the first byte in this segment.
- **Acknowledgment Number**: Next expected byte from the other side.
- **Flags**: Control bits (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, etc.).
- **Window Size**: Used for flow control.
- **Checksum**: Error checking.
- **Options**: Used for things like window scaling, timestamps.

## 🧠 TCP Concepts You Should Know

### ✅ 1. **Sequence Numbers & Acknowledgments**
Every byte of data is numbered. This ensures:
- **Order is preserved**
- **Duplicates are detected**
- **Lost segments are retransmitted**

### ✅ 2. **Flow Control**
Uses a **sliding window protocol** to prevent sender from overwhelming the receiver. The receiver advertises how much data it can handle (`Window Size`).

### ✅ 3. **Congestion Control**
TCP assumes congestion if packets are dropped. It uses algorithms like:

- **Slow Start**
- **Congestion Avoidance**
- **Fast Retransmit**
- **Fast Recovery**

These adjust the rate of sending data based on network feedback.

### ✅ 4. **Retransmission**
If an ACK isn’t received within a **timeout**, the segment is **retransmitted**. TCP is smart about this — it dynamically adjusts timeouts.

### ✅ 5. **Nagle’s Algorithm**
Reduces the number of small packets by buffering data — unless it’s told not to (e.g., with `TCP_NODELAY`).

### ✅ 6. **Delayed ACKs**
TCP may wait a little before sending an ACK in case it can piggyback it with outgoing data.

## 🔓 Common TCP Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **SYN** | Initiate a connection |
| **ACK** | Acknowledgment |
| **FIN** | Terminate a connection |
| **RST** | Reset the connection |
| **PSH** | Push buffered data |
| **URG** | Urgent pointer field is significant |

## 🔍 TCP in Action (Example: HTTP over TCP)

1. **Browser wants a webpage**
    - Opens a socket.
    - Starts a TCP connection (3-way handshake).
2. **Sends HTTP GET request**
    - Over established TCP connection.
3. **Receives HTTP response**
    - TCP ensures data is ordered and reliable.
4. **Closes TCP connection**

---

## 💣 Common Attacks on TCP

- **SYN Flood** – Attacker sends a ton of SYNs without completing handshakes, consuming server resources.
- **TCP Reset (RST) Attack** – Injecting RST packets to kill a connection.
- **Session Hijacking** – Guessing sequence numbers to inject data.

## 🚫 When NOT to Use TCP?

TCP is awesome, but sometimes overkill.

Use **UDP** when you need:
- Speed > Reliability (e.g., video streaming, games, DNS)
- Lower latency
- No connection setup overhead

## 🧠 What is UDP?

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is a **connectionless** transport layer protocol in the **TCP/IP suite**, defined in **RFC 768**. It's designed for **speed and simplicity**, making it ideal for applications where performance matters more than guaranteed delivery.

## ⚡ UDP – Fast, Unreliable Transmission

**Key Features:**
- **Connectionless**: No handshake or connection setup; sends data directly.
- **Unreliable**: No guarantee of delivery, order, or duplication check.
- **No Error/Flow Control**: Leaves it to the application layer, if needed.
- **Faster**: Minimal overhead, ideal for time-sensitive applications.
- **No Sequence Handling**: Receiver gets packets in the order they arrive (if at all).

**Use Cases:**
- Voice/Video Calls (e.g., WhatsApp, Zoom)
- VoIP (Voice over IP): Real-time communication
- Live video/audio streaming: Losing a frame is better than waiting.
- Online gaming: Speed > reliability.
- DNS (Domain Name System) Queries: One small query, one response.
- DHCP: No need for connection
- SNMP: Monitoring with small, quick messages.

## 🧱 UDP Packet Structure (Header Format)

```
0      7      15     23     31
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Source Port      | Destination Port  |
+------------------+-------------------+
| Length           | Checksum          |
+------------------+-------------------+
|               Data (Payload)         |
+--------------------------------------+
```

### 🧩 Fields Breakdown:

- **Source Port**: Port of sender.
- **Destination Port**: Port of receiver.
- **Length**: Total length of header + data.
- **Checksum**: Error detection (optional in IPv4, mandatory in IPv6).
- **Data**: The actual message.

## ⚙️ How UDP Works

### No Handshake

Unlike TCP, there's:
- ❌ No SYN
- ❌ No ACK
- ❌ No session setup
- Just: **Send → Receive (if it gets there)**

## ⚡ When to Use UDP

UDP is great when:
- You need **low latency**.
- Packet loss is **acceptable or managed by the app**.
- You send **small amounts of data**.
- You’re working with **broadcast or multicast**.

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're at a party yelling out trivia questions (UDP) vs. making sure someone hears, understands, and replies to each one (TCP).

- **UDP**: "What's 2 + 2?" [You move on, no matter if anyone heard.]
- **TCP**: "What's 2 + 2?" → "4" → "Thanks, got it!"

## 🕳️ Drawbacks of UDP

| Limitation           | Why it matters |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **No reliability**   | Packets may be dropped or duplicated. |
| **No congestion control** | Can flood the network if unmanaged. |
| **No flow control** | Can overwhelm slower receivers. |
| **No ordering** | App must reorder messages if needed. |

## 🔐 Is UDP Secure?

On its own? No.

But it's often used with encryption and authentication layers:
- **DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)** — UDP version of TLS.
- **QUIC** (used in HTTP/3) is built on UDP, but adds reliability, security, multiplexing.

## 🔒 Attacks Involving UDP

| Attack Type         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **UDP Flood**       | Overwhelms target with UDP packets. |
| **DNS Amplification** | Uses open DNS servers to reflect massive responses to a target. |
| **Port Scanning**   | Attackers send packets to many ports and analyze responses. |

## 🛠️ Tools to Work with TCP and UDP

- **Wireshark** – Inspect TCP and UDP packets and analyze flows.
- **netstat / ss** – Show active TCP connections.
- **netcat (`nc`)** – Send and receive UDP manually.
- **iperf/iperf3** – Test TCP and UDP performance.
- **dig** – Send DNS queries over UDP.
- **tcpdump** – Capture TCP traffic from the command line.

## 🎯 Summary

**UDP** is your go-to protocol when:
- Speed is critical
- Dropping some data isn’t fatal
- You’re handling real-time or stateless data

It's fast, simple, and effective — **if your application handles the chaos**.

### 🎯 Final Thoughts:
- Use **TCP** when **reliability and data integrity** matter.
- Use **UDP** when **speed and low latency** are more important than guaranteed delivery.
