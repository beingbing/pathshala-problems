~~ Link State Routing and Hierarchical Routing ~~

Distance Vector Routing was too slow hence we have this method.

Every node calculates its adjacency list and flood it across network, hence, every other node will know about it now.
Hence, every node will know about the complete graph.

These were the two algorithms, giving us shortest path in a network.

Downsides of above two (DVR and LSR) algos -
- as internet has huge number of nodes so their routing tables will be very big, with millions of entries. So, not practical.

Then, what we use to actually connect the whole internet ?
so, to actually connect the whole network, we follow a Hierarchical form of routing.
- in LANs DVR or LSR is used
- we create a bigger internet by using one edge router from each LAN (called gateway routers).
- node from each LAN first check presence of address in their LAN, if not they pass the packet to gateway router.
- now the gateway will look for a LAN which has that address and pass the packet to gateway router of that LAN.
- these blueprint will be replicated over MAN and WAN.

# information stored by each router -
- LAN internal routers only stores information about gateway node and other internal nodes
- gateway router will store information about other gateways and its LAN internal nodes.

Note: all these algorithms we discussed till now were for a single-source-single-destination model, also called unicast (1v1)
algorithms.

then, how broadcast (send to everyone), multicast (send to a selected group) and anycast (send to any one of selected) happen ?
