Till now we have establish pier to pier communication and reliability and creating a path from source to destination to
establish a communication over a distance.

But, what about the reliability of that path establish, how can we make sure that packet which is received at destination
is not manipulated or hampered with on the way by some node. We haven't ensured reliability over the path established.

This is where Transport layer comes in.

First it does error control just like DLL, but on the complete path (DLL error control was for pier to pier).
then, Flow Control
then, congestion Control (responsibility of network + transport layers): reroute packets to some other path if congestion.

we will also discuss, TCP and UDP protocols used in Transport layer.
