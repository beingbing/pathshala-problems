## üß± Devices in Physical and Data Link Layers

Before moving to the **Network Layer**, it's important to understand the core devices that operate at the **Physical** and **Data Link Layers**. These devices help manage data transmission within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

### üß≤ 1. Modem (PHYSICAL LAYER)

- **Purpose**: Converts **digital signals to analog (modulation)** and **analog signals back to digital (demodulation)**.
- **Used for**: Connecting digital devices (like computers) to analog systems (like telephone lines).
- **Name** = MOdulator + DEModulator.

### üì∂ 2. Repeater (PHYSICAL LAYER)

- **Purpose**: Boosts signal strength to overcome **attenuation** (signal loss over distance).
- **How it works**: Reads the incoming signal, **amplifies** it, and forwards it.
- **Hardware only**: No software or logic involved.
- **Ports**: Simple device with **2 ports** ‚Äì input and output.

---

### üîå 3. Hub (PHYSICAL LAYER)

- **Purpose**: Basic multi-port repeater.
- **How it works**: Receives a signal from one port, **amplifies**, and **broadcasts** it to **all other ports**.
- **No intelligence**: It doesn‚Äôt know who the message is for.
- **Used in**: Small LANs, where traffic is low and security isn't a major concern.

### üì≤ 4. Switch (DATA LINK LAYER)

- **Purpose**: Smarter alternative to a hub.
- **How it works**: Uses **MAC addresses** to forward the frame only to the **intended recipient port**, not to everyone.
- **Selective transmission**: Reduces unnecessary traffic.
- **Part of**: **Data Link Layer**, as it uses frame addressing logic.

---

### üåâ 5. Bridge (DATA LINK LAYER)

- **Purpose**: Connects **two or more LANs** that may use **different control mechanisms**.
- **How it works**: Reads frame headers, filters traffic, and **forwards only necessary data** between LANs.
- **Also in DLL**: Uses MAC addresses to make decisions, just like switches.

> üìå Note: Each LAN might use different **frame formats** and **access control techniques**. The **bridge** helps ensure smooth communication **between** such networks.
