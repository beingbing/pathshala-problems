~~ Multicasting and Anycasting Algorithms ~~

multicast: broadcast to a selected people.

# do broadcast and assume that only relevant nodes will read.
drawbacks:
- security: we are assuming that other nodes will not try to read it if the packet is not intended for them.
- unnecessary transfers

# do multicast using unicast
drawbacks:
- if group is too big, then too many unnecessary transfers.

# create multicast groups: group of nodes that belong to a multicast group
practically not always a perfect group can be formed, so we try to create a sub network which has all the nodes of a multicast
group with least possible extra nodes.
by using this we can reduce security and unnecessary transfer risk to as minimum as possible.

How to setup such sub network ?
for that we have a concept of rendezvous point.

rendezvous point: amongst the member of multicast group, they decide a node which will be a rendezvous point.

then, all other nodes will try to find shortest path to rendezvous point.


* Anycast:
all the packets of anycast have all the destinations listed so each router can decide which destination is closer to it and
then send the packet in that direction.
