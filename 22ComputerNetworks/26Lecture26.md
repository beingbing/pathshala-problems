## 🛠️ Transport Layer Deep Dive: Error Control & Flow Control

The **Transport Layer** enhances communication reliability by adding mechanisms to **detect errors** and **regulate data flow** between source and destination — across the entire network path.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔁 1. Error Control

**Goal:** Ensure that the data received at the destination is **exactly** what was sent by the source — no corruption, loss, or duplication.

- Every transport layer packet includes a **checksum** in its header.
- The checksum is generated by applying a **hash function** to the packet’s data.
- At the destination, this checksum is **recomputed and compared** with the one sent.
- If they don't match, the packet is considered **corrupted** and is either discarded or a **retransmission** is requested.

> ✅ This is **similar to error control in the Data Link Layer**, but while DLL does it **hop-by-hop**, the Transport Layer ensures **end-to-end** reliability.

### 🧭 2. Flow Control

**Goal:** Prevent the sender from **overwhelming** the receiver by sending data too quickly.

- Ensures that the **receiver’s buffer** doesn’t overflow.
- Works by using mechanisms like **acknowledgements** and **window sizes** to regulate how much data can be in transit.
- Similar in concept to flow control in the DLL, but here it operates **across the full path from sender to receiver**, not just between neighboring nodes.

> ⏱️ Since the transport path is longer, **timers and delays** tend to be higher than in the Data Link Layer.

### 🚥 Up Next: Congestion Control

While flow control manages the **sender-receiver** relationship, **congestion control** addresses the overall **health of the network**.

We'll dive into how the transport layer helps prevent network overloads next.
