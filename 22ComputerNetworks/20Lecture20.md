## 📢 Broadcasting in Networks

**Goal:** Send a message from one node to **all other nodes** in the network.

---

### ❓ What's the simplest way to broadcast?

#### ✅ **Approach 1: Multiple Unicasts**

Send a separate unicast message to every other node one by one.

**Drawbacks:**
- Sends **too many redundant packets**.
- Wastes bandwidth due to **repeated transmissions**.
- Not scalable or efficient.

---

### 🔁 **Approach 2: Flooding / DFS-like Broadcasting**

Send the packet to **all immediate neighbors**, and they do the same recursively.

**Problems with flooding:**
- **Loops**: In networks with cycles, the same packet can circulate indefinitely.
- Tracking **visited nodes** doesn't help, because multiple broadcasts might be happening simultaneously.
- So routers maintain a **Visited Packet Table** to avoid resending the same packet.

**But**:
- This solution is **memory-heavy**.
- Not ideal for efficient broadcasting.

## 🔄 Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) — A Smarter Broadcast

To solve the issues with flooding, we use **Reverse Path Forwarding**.

### 🧠 Key Idea:

A router **only forwards** a broadcast packet **if it arrives on the link that lies along the shortest path back to the source**.

This means:
- If the packet comes from a direction **that isn’t optimal**, it is **dropped**.
- Ensures **loop-free and efficient** message distribution.

### ✅ Advantages of RPF:
- Prevents **loops** without heavy memory usage.
- Uses **existing unicast routing tables** to determine shortest paths.
- More scalable and **practical for broadcasting** in large networks.
