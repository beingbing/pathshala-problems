~~ devices in physical and data link layer ~~

discussing devices before moving on to the next layer.

- modem: modulation and demodulation device. already discussed.

- repeater: to send signal over long range, they face loss in energy (amplitude), which is called attenuation. To remedy this,
we use repeater. it reads the message, amplify its amplitude and then forward it.
It's a simple hardware device available in physical layer with not software attached to it.
It has two ports, one for input and other for output.

- hub: same as repeater but has multiple ports. If a port receive a message, it will be amplified and sent across all the wires.
It simply broadcast the received message. No logic is involved, its a hardware device, present in physical layer.

- switch: similar to hub but it has a logic associated with it. It will not broadcast the received message. It will read the
address on the message and then send it to that port only. kind of selective hub, only send messages to those who are destined
for it. its a part of DLL.

Note: All these devices are a part of single LAN.

control mechanism can differ from LAN to LAN. So, there frame type and their understanding can be totally different. So to link
these LANs we have a device called Bridge. It is also a DLL device.
