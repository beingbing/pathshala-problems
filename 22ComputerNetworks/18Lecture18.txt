~~ Distance Vector Routing ~~

It simply says, if a intermediate router gives us a better path to reach destination then we direct our packets through it.

steps involved -
- routers wake up
- create there routing table by contacting neighbors. (keep updating the information by sending test packets regularly)
- routers starts exchanging there routing tables with each other. so that they can see to what other routers there
neighbors can reach and they themselves start making entry of those routers in there table with path via their neighbors.

drawbacks:
- slowness of information sharing
- count to infinity problem (if a router goes down it's direct neighbors update all others that if you had a connection to
the down router through me then change it to infinity because i have lost my connection to it.) It is also called as route
poisoning.
