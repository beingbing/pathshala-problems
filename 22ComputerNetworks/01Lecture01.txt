~~ introduction to computer networks ~~

hosting: putting your code on a machine and exposing it to the outside world.

1. software (browser) knows / gets to know where the page is hosted.
2. we establish a connection with that machine.
3. we make a request
4. we get a response.

so, if we want to access a webpage hosted on a machine then our browser makes a connection with that machine and then
makes a request to get a response.

parameters about which we should care about is -
- speed
- reliability
