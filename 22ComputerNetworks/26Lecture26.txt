~~ error and flow control ~~

will dwell deeper into functionalities provided by transport layer -
- error control:
packets received by destination are the same as what were sent by source.

packet      -- + header -->   frame     -- + headers -->   IP packet   -- + headers -->   packet

physical                    data link                       network                      transport
layer                       layer                           layer                           layer

header in transport layer includes a hash which is obtained by passing the complete packet through a hash function.
Very similar to DLL error control.

- flow control:
Again very similar to DLL flow control but working for over a complete path. The only difference maybe that the timer value
is higher

- congestion control:

we will discuss them one by one.
