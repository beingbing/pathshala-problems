~~ multiplexing ~~

not completely related to physical layer, but somewhat important to understand, to understand next lectures better.

If you want to setup a network in an area. So, we have a router for that area, which is connected that area with outside
world via a connection.
Now, we need to connect 4 different lane in that area to our given router, and assume there are 3 houses in each lane,

- getting one wire for each house: wastage (too far away) and under utilization (some people might be sparingly using it)
of resources. 

- a common wire for each lane: that wire is again connected to a router, and from that router we have wires going to
each house. So, there can be some common pathways which will be serving multiple people at the same time.
Issue with this idea is: there is a high chance of collisions happening in the signal, when signal are merging into a
common wire.
Solving this issue is called multiplexing.
so, problem statement:

If a wire is used to support multiple signals, how do you make sure that those signals do not collide and gets corrupted.

There are a few techniques to solve that -

- frequency division multiplexing (FDM): Different routes alloted different frequencies, but it is still not full proof.

- time division multiplexing: At a particular time only one connection is allowed to send data and we give time to those
machines in a round robin manner.
