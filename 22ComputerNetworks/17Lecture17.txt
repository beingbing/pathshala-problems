~~ connectionless routing ~~

also called as Datagram.

whatever be the destination, which node will give shortest path to given destination ?

shortest path to each node from given router.

Dijkstra algorithm can be used to know the shortest path from a source to destination.

for applying Dijkstra we need to know complete network as a graph.

so, problem 1. we need to know complete graph to be able to apply Dijkstra.

problem 2. how to define weights in graph ?
- length of a wire (not good parameter, as there are too many other factors which can prove our assessment wrong)
- send a test packet and then determine weight based on travel time. (test packet is also sometimes called ECHO packet)
the problem with this approach is the weight need to be reviewed frequently.

so the problem can be recalibrates as -
1. need to know complete information about the graph
2. need to be updated about change in that information and whenever that happen we need to recalculate the shortest path.

we have different approaches to resolve the above two problems, we will see them next.
