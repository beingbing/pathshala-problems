~~ introduction to network layer ~~

third layer of OSI model.

till now we were able to establish communication for pier to pier and also for a LAN.

responsibility: route packets from source to destination.

IP address (internet protocol address): unique for your machine on internet.

packets have their destination IP addresses in them.

throughout the network we have routers, which have routing tables using which they route the message in the right direction.

ISPs put out these routers to provide us internet service.
