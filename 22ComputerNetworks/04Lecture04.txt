~~ modem device ~~

We need to understand how communication is done between two heterogeneous devices.

As we know that medium of communication has two types, light and electricity. and both of them are continuous propagation
medium. Which means there is a continuous stream of data sent in analog form. But some devices possibly can understand only
digital form of communication (binary).
Hence we need to convert signal from digital to analog (demodulation) and vice versa (modulation).

To make that conversion possible we have a device called modem. It is a physical layer device.

nowadays, we do not use a modem device separately, normally our routers has in-build modem capabilities now.

so, with all those discussions above we made sure that a pier to pier communication is happening. So, data link layer is
just ensures that this communication has happened properly. Signal/information is not lost due to any interference. simply put,
this layer does error control.

second responsibility of data link layer is to ensure there is no congestion and there is a proper flow control.

responsibility of data link layer -
- error control
- flow control

congestion: one device among the two present is capable of producing signals of high intensity while other is not capable
of working on that high capacity.

but, before we move on to data link layer, there are two more concepts which we need to discuss.
