~~ congestion control: traffic aware routing ~~

majorly happens on network layer.

Assume that there are two routes from source and destination, with one being shorter than other.
Then, most of the times packets will be sent from shorter path, but if destination is slower in receiving then the speed
by which source is producing packets. Then it will lead to congestion.
so, we just need to change the routing table based on congestion, so that other alternative paths can be explored.

To do that updation, we can send an ECHO packet through all the paths and then see which packet got received first.

This approach is called Traffic Aware Routing, which simply means, based on your traffic be aware of routing.

but this do not solve the root cause of our problem.
The actual problem is that our source is too fast in generating packets, so much so that we have to explore alternative
routes. So, no matter how many paths we have, all of them will be congested. Hence, this approach has a very common
drawback, which is called Oscillating Route Table. In which, routing table will keep Oscillating between paths, as source
will be clogging all of them and then will look for the least clogged route.
