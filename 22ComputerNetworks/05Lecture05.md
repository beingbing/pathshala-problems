## üì∂ Multiplexing ‚Äì Efficient Use of Shared Communication Medium

### üîß The Real-World Problem

Suppose you‚Äôre setting up a network in a neighborhood. You have:

- A **main router** that connects the area to the outside world.
- **4 lanes**, each with **3 houses**.

#### üß± Option 1: One wire per house
Too expensive and inefficient ‚Äî
- Wastage of resources (wires going too far for few users)
- Underutilization (some users might barely use the connection)

#### üîÄ Option 2: One common wire per lane
Each lane shares one wire that connects to the main router.  
From there, smaller wires split into each house.

‚úÖ This is more efficient.  
‚ùå But it introduces a new problem: **signal collision**  
If multiple users send data at the same time, signals might **interfere**, leading to **data corruption**.

### üéØ Enter Multiplexing

> **Multiplexing** is the technique used to allow multiple signals to share a single medium **without colliding**.

It answers the key question:
> _If multiple users share one communication line, how do we prevent their data from interfering with each other?_

### ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Multiplexing

#### 1. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**
- Each user is assigned a **different frequency range** to transmit their signal.
- Works like FM radio ‚Äî many channels (stations) on different frequencies.
- Still not foolproof ‚Äî overlapping signals or external interference can cause issues.

#### 2. **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**
- Each user is assigned a specific **time slot** in a **round-robin** fashion.
- Only one user sends data at a time, reducing the chance of collision.
- Efficient when users take turns quickly ‚Äî feels simultaneous.
