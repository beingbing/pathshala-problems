~~ IP Addressing ~~

Internet Protocol address: every machine's address over the internet. which is unique for everyone.

why do we need them ?
- MAC address is very huge
- MAC address is very random
- so that we can shrink the size of routing table
- to be able to implement regulations over IP addresses. like 12.__.__.__ is for india.

IP addresses are dynamic in nature and are allocated via routers using DHCP (dynamic host control protocol).
