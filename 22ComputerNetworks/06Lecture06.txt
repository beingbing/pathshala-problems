~~ switching technologies ~~

circuit switching: a path is established from source to destination via some operators and then all data transfer takes place from that path.
- establish a path
- only you can use all the machines during this call.

drawbacks -
- under utilization of resources (limit on amount of users at a time)
- single point of failure: if one node goes down, complete connection breaks.


packet switching: information is broken down into small chunks, and each chunk is called a packet. Each packet will be send to the next node which
will be most suitable to accommodate the packet and can help that packet reach the destination.
This method resolves both the drawbacks of above process. But new drawbacks are -
- very complex to design, as a lot of logic needs to be establish at each node.
- packets are received out of order. (destination need to re-sequence the packets)
- losses are packet dropping is still there.
