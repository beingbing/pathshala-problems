~~ Congestion Control: Traffic Throttling ~~

so we actually need a way to tell Source to slow down packet generation speed.

So, to be able to inform about congestion, we must first be able to detect it.
Routers will be the ones which can effectively detect if congestion is happening.
As we know, router has a queue to route different packets hence if router queue size grows above a certain threshold for a
particular destination then it can predict that congestion is happening.

Once congestion is predicted, then we need to prevent it. For that, router will release a CHOKE packet reporting back to sender
asking it to slow down.

Q. how will router know to which sender CHOKE packet should go ?
A. router uses ECN (explicit congestion notification).
We will pick one random packet from the queue, and assume it to be from the Source causing congestion. And then we notify
the Source of that packet.

drawback:
- by the time choke packet reaches the Source, more packets would have congested the network.

so, due to this drawback, we use an alternative to ECN called hop by hop back-pressure.
We inform pier by pier to slow down forwarding packets.

still we are not informing Source about the problem. Let's see in next lecture.
