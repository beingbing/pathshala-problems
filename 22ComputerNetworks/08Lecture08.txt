~~ error control ~~

types of errors caused by interference -

- single bit error: 
example, 110110101  -> 110100101

to resolve it, we introduce a parity bit in our data.
parity bit: we keep a measure of count of number of ones in our message. if count of ones are even we append 0 at the end and vice versa.

- burst error: some magnetic/electric field disturbing the message traveling in wire, due to presence of heavy machinery in vicinity.
to resolve it, we have cyclic redundancy check.
both source and destination decides on a random number between 1 and decimal representation of that message, then, modulo is done and result
of modulo is appended at the end of message. that modulo result is appended with 0s till the appending binary number become as wide as that
random number chosen.
Although this method is not full proof but it is highly unlikely that distortion happen such that new message still passes the cyclic
redundancy check.
