~~ connection oriented routing ~~

every packet received by a router has address on it. when a packet reach a router, router forwards the packet to the next
correct router.

Routing table
destination :: next destination (router)

router uses store and forward technique -
when a packet is received, it is stored then forwarded to next router. The storing part is important because if a packet gets
dropped once it leaves a router, then it is the responsibility of that router to resend a duplicate packet.
for forwarding -
- connection oriented forwarding (virtual connection routing): 
    - test packets are flooded (sent all over) by the router in the network, till it reaches its destination.
    - destination sends ACK to the source router whose packet was received first, which then traces back to the actual source.
    - all the intermediary routers will store the location next router which sent ACK back to them for that test packet with
    key as actual destination.

    drawbacks -
    - we need to do a discovery to find our destination.
    - networks are dynamic in nature, new devices keeps on adding or other keeps on removing, so the shortest path may not be the 
    shortest in long run, or it may happen that that path is no longer exist.
