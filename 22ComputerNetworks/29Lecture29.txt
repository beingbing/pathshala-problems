~~ Congestion Control: Admission Control ~~

Third approach for congestion control is Admission Control which prevents congestion from happening.

Until now we were reactive rather than being pro-active. That means we waited for signs of congestion to appear then we
started taking actions. Here we do not let congestion to happen.

Every router in a network will have a maximum limit on amount of packets it will send in a time frame.
There are two approaches of doing this -
- leaky bucket: whatever be the inflow, we allow outflow at a certain rate.
drawback: the outflow rate can make late arriving packets wait. 
- token bucket: we have a certain amount of tokens available, outflow access will be given via a token, and those tokens
were replenished ata certain rate. It do not have leaky bucket drawback.

Note: both of these approaches are general computer science algorithms which are used whenever we want to limit rate or
do Throttling.
