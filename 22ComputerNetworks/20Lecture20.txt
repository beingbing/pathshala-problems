~~ broadcasting algorithms ~~

# unicast to every node one by one
drawbacks:
- extra packets
- unnecessary transfers

# DFS / flooding: we send packets to our neighbors, they will send it to their neighbors and goes on.
drawbacks:
- if graph has cycles then it may go into an infinite loop.
- keeping of visited array for not do not make much sense. Instead we keep a visited packets table to keep record of packets
forwarded so that we do not forward a packet on loop. But this too is very memory intensive.
so,
impractical for broadcast

# reverse path forwarding: router will forward only those packets which come from shortest path from source.
