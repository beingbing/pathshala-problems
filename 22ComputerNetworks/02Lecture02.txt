~~ OSI (open systems inter-communication) Model ~~

by applying Single Responsibility Principle, we have divided internet into layers. Each layer has a specific responsibility
and every new layer abstract out the lower layers.

so, the only job of internet is, to establish a connection and send the data across it.

lowest layer talks about connection between adjacent nodes (pier to pier data transfer)
it is split into two layers -
- data link layer
- physical layer

finding a route from source to destination path and then transferring data between them.
it is split into two layers -
- transport layer
- network layer

the transfer data should be converted into understandable form.
for transferring data, we use protocols, so, every type of communication/data-transfer might be using different protocols.
It is handled by -
- application layer
- presentation layer
- session layer

protocol: if two entities want to communicate then they need to establish some set of rules that they will follow in their
communication.

Every layer will only communicate with immediate lower and upper layer.
