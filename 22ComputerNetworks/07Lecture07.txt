~~ Introduction to data link layer ~~

everything we discussed in physical layer was related to hardware.
hence, we need data link layer as it relates with software part of it.

responsibility: DLL needs to ensure that packet transfer happens properly

1. error control: ensure that whatever message is received is correct, and if not then discard it and then ask for that packet again from source.

source          --->            destination
xyz           interference      xya

then destination need to discard that packet.

2. flow control: the connection should be reliable, that means, a packet should reach destination. And if a packet is dropped then it is resent from source.

3. access control: if both source and destination are sending signals then those signals should not be lost due to collision.

frame: a packet with data wrapped with some meta data (headers/footers) containing information about that packet to ensure packet functioning.
