~~ Congestion control: load shedding and RED ~~

what to do when congestion has already happened ?

load shedding: when congestion happens we try to remove certain packets altogether.

which packets should the Router drop ?

it depends of type of network we are dealing with.

1. Live stream - better to drop older packets. (milk approach)

2. document transfer - better to drop newer/latest packets. (wine approach)


# Random early detection
routers are always in congestion prevention mode. Every routers will always be in load shedding mode, if queue ever gets filled > x% they will start
shedding/dropping.
