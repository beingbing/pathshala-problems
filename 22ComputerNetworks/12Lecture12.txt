~~ network topologies ~~

how the devices are organized in a LAN so that we are able to easily manage the network.

type of devices organization is called network topology.

- star topology: hub/switch in the middle and all the devices are connect to it.

- bus topology: every node dumps there messages in carrier wire and all other nodes read them, if a message has same address
as theirs, then the designated node picks up the message and reads it.

- mesh topology: all the nodes are organized in the form of graph. messages get propagated following DFS to all the neighbors.
and with the help of BFS, messages reaches its destination. If a node receives a message twice then it will not be transferred
further again. So every device has a history of messages that it has already passed on.

for pier to pier communication between nodes in a LAN no further layers are required. the physical and DL layers are enough.
