~~ public vs private IP and firewall ~~

proxy pattern: someone pretends to be you on behalf of you.

IANA has provisioned certain IPs for only private use. They can be only used as private IP addresses.

When in an organization, there are a few public facing IP addresses called public IPs which accepts packets on behalf of
complete organization and then forward them to company machines via some private IPs which are only known to them. Then
those public IPs can shield those private IPs from receiving messages from any specific non trusted IP address from outside
world. These feature is called firewall.

VPN is one way by using which we can avoid firewalls, lets discuss it next.
