~~ Fundamental Concepts ~~

Arrays -
1. collection of elements of same data type
2. fixed size (not in dynamic array)
3. contiguous memory allocation

Explained how memory allocation in dynamic arrays(vector) works.
 - new memory location is assigned with greater memory then previously provided
 - amortized(average) will still be O(1)

 amortized   =   number          /      number of   
 complexity      of operation   /        insertions (push backs)

name of the array acts as a base address of the array

by default, array is passed by reference.

to pass a vector by reference, you need to add & in function parameters.
