~~ maximum chunks ~~
given an array with elements value belonging to [0, n-1], find max chunks
to split so that sorting and again concatenating the chunks give a sorted
original array

so, the simplest approach is to track prefix max of the array elements,
whenever prefix max is equal to the index at which we are currently at
then we have a potential chunk, increment your count and move forward.
