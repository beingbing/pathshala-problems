~~ pass by reference ~~

variable can be passed to a function in two ways
1. pass by value
2. pass by reference

1. content of variable copied into a new container, no changes will be reflected in the
variable of caller function

2. content of variable get referenced to the called function, changes made will be permanent
and will be reflected in caller function
