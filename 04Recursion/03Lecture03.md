# Recursion Tree Diagrams
## Two-Branch Recursion
In two-branch recursion, each recursive call spawns two additional recursive calls, leading to an exponential growth in calls, visualized as a tree structure known as a *recursion tree*.
### Example
Consider the following function, which recursively calls itself twice with adjusted values of `n`:
```java
void func(int x) {
    System.out.print(x + " ");
    if (x >= 3) return;  // Termination condition
    func(x + 1);         // First recursive call
    func(x + 2);         // Second recursive call
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    func(0);  // Start the recursion
}
```
#### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Recursion begins by calling `func(0)`.
- **Termination Condition**: The recursion halts if `x >= 3`.
- **Recurrence Relations**: `func(x + 1)` and `func(x + 2)`.

#### Output:
`0 1 2 3 4 3 2 3 4`

#### Recursion Tree Diagram for `func(0)`
The recursion tree diagram below shows the structure of calls for `func(0)`, where each function call generates two child calls:

```plaintext
                                func(0)
                                /       \
                         func(1)        func(2)
                         /     \         /     \
                   func(2)  func(3) func(3)   func(4)
                   /     \
              func(3)   func(4)
```
- Each subtree represents the recursive process for that specific value.
- The tree captures the order and hierarchy of recursive calls, with each node leading to two more calls until the termination condition is met.

#### Time Complexity and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^n)` because each call generates two additional calls, creating an exponential growth in the number of calls.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the depth of the recursion stack (in depth-first traversal).

### Flow of Execution and Call Stack
1. **Top-to-Bottom Execution**: The function expands in a depth-first manner, with each call branching out to two more calls, filling the call stack.
2. **Left-to-Right Output Sequence**: The output is generated by visiting each node in a left-to-right order within the depth-first traversal.

### Concept of Recursion Tree
A recursion tree is a visual representation of recursive calls, useful for understanding how recursive functions break down complex problems. Each node represents a recursive call, with its children representing subsequent calls made within it.
