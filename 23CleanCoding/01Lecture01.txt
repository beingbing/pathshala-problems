~~ what is clean coding ~~

We write clean code for other humans, machine doesn't care.

clean code importance ^ ans team size ^

A wrong code which is understandable in nature is better than clean code which is not
understandable.

dirtiness of code -
- bad variable/function names
- a lot of decision branches
- repetation of logic
- delegate operations to other functions
- one function should be responsible for one action
- keep function pure as much as possible
- passing a lot of parameters is not good
