~~ clean functions ~~

- a function should be responsible for one action only (their unique responsiblility)

- main should declare process, no implementation step should be in main. Every step
or action should have either it's own function or should be in a well Descriptive
variable.
main function should contain only lines of code which are 1 level abstraction below it
other all should be in their separate functions.

drawbacks of a bad function -
- there are too many lines
- does too many things

- a function should do exactly one thing if either of them holds -
a. one can't meaningfully extract any other function from it.
b. all lines are just one level of abstraction below the function's level

example,

            printAdjCoPrimePairsWithSameParity

    changeSumToAbsVal       areCoPrime      isParitySame        printPair

    math.abs()              getGCD          bit operators
