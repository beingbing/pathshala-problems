~~ maximum XOR in an array ~~

given int a[n] where 0 <= a[i] <= (2^m - 1)
and queries[m] of size M

max xor of query element with any element from array.

MSB -> LSB

algo -
- convert given query number into binary
- traverse query binary number 
 - if encounter 0 go for 1(left)
 - if encounter 1 go for 0(right)
 - else traverse whichever node available.
- complete the traverse, xor the query number with obtained number and print the answer.

TC = O(n*M + m*M)
SC = O(n*M)
