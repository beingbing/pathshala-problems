~~ BFS tree ~~

BFS tree is a tree whose level order traversal is same as BFS of our graph.

edges which are prompting us to add nodes in queue will be present in tree.

every node in BFS tree is at as low level as possible.

if ever to find the shortest path of a node from other nodes, then it can be easily done by
computing the level in BFS tree.
