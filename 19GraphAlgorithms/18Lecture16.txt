~~ capture surrounded regions ~~

given an nxm matrix with either x or o as its element. All the islands which are surrounded by x's
should be captured. Boundry connected islands cant be captured.

replace all o's with boundry to be a's then iterate all over again and switch all a's to o's and all
o's to x's.
