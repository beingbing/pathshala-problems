~~ what is a graph ~~

As soon as a cycle gets introduced in a tree, that cycle destroys the heirarchical structure and then
the tree is called as a graph.

every tree is a graph without a cycle.

graph: nodes + edges

- types of graph
- traversal on graph
- directed graph: topological sorting and strongly connected components
- articulation points and bridges
- disjoint set-union: minimum spanning trees
- shortest path algorithms
- non-graph seeming problems
