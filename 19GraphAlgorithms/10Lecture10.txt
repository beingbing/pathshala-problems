~~ rotten oranges ~~

given nxm grid, where every cell is either 0(empty cell), 1(fresh orange), 2(rotten orange).
Every minute a rotten orange make it's adjacent fresh orange as rotten.
After how much time will all the oranges be rotten in the grid.

If graph has disconnected components which doesn't have any rotten orange, then answer will be INF.
as all the oranges will never rot.

every orange will rot in time t = distance to nearest rotten orange.

It is very similar to the previous problem.
