~~ important terms for graph ~~

Nodes: similar to nodes of a tree
edges: connecting two nodes.

based on edges graph can be divided into categories -
- bidirectional connection: undirected graphs
- directed graph: unidirectional edges/connection

an undirected graph can be represented using a directed graph.

- weighted graph
- unweighted graph

- complete graph: every node is connected to every other node.
no of edges in an undirected complete graph = nC2
no of edges in an undirected complete graph = nC2 * 2

adjacent nodes: directly connected via an edge
reachable nodes: there is a path between them, connecting them.
path: a sequence of edges

disconnected graphs can be classified into connected components.

self loop: if some node has an edge from itself to itself.
parallel edges: making parallel connection between same two nodes.

cycle in a graph: starts from node i and ends at node i using simple path.

simple path: is a path without repeating edges.

self loop is a cycle.

bipartite graphs: if a graph can be coloured using only two colors such that no two adjacent
nodes have same color.
odd length cycles are not bipartite.
