### Degree of a Node in a Graph
The **degree of a node** in a graph is the number of edges connected to it. Each edge contributes `+1` to the degree of its endpoints.

#### Key Properties:
1. **Sum of Degrees in an Undirected Graph:**  
   - Each edge contributes `+2` to the total degree (once for each endpoint).
   - Sum of degrees = 2 * Number of edges

2. **Degree in Directed Graphs:**  
   - **In-Degree:** The number of edges entering a node.  
   - **Out-Degree:** The number of edges leaving a node.  
   - Total degree = In-Degree + Out-Degree
   - Sum of in-degrees = Sum of out-degrees = Total number of edges.

3. **Degree in a Complete Graph:**  
   In a complete graph with `v` nodes, each node is connected to every other node.  
   Degree of each node = `v-1`.
