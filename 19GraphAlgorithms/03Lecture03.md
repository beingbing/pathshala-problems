~~ degree of a node ~~

no of adjacent edges on the node.

every edge contributes 1 degree to both the nodes.

every edge contributes +2 to sum of all the degrees.
so, sum of all the degress = 2*(no of edges)


degree in directed graphs:
degree = indegree + outdegree
indegree: the no of edges entering into the nodes.
outdegree: no of edges entering out of the nodes.

sum of indegree = no of edges
sum of outdegree = no of edges

in a complete graph with v nodes the degree of each node will be (v-1)
