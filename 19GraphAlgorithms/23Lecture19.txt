~~ detect cycle in directed graph ~~

0: not visited
1: visited in current path
2: visited in any other path

if we visit something which has 1, then its a cycle.

bool cycle = false;
int visited[n] = {0};

dfs(int node) {
    if (visited[node]) {
        if (visited[node] == 1) cycle = true;
        return;
    }
    visited[node] = 1;
    for (i{0}; i<adj[node].size(); i++) dfs(adj[node][i]);
    visited[node] = 2;
}
TC = O(v+e)
SC = O(v)
