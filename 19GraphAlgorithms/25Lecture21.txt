~~ course scheduler ~~

student wants to be in n different courses from 0 to n-1. there are some prerequisite courses for some
particular courses. the prerequisite list is given. then find in what order can a student complete all
courses. 

we can model it as a graph, all the courses will be nodes, and all the prerequisites will be directed
edges. and then this problem becomes a topological sort problem.

if (ans.size != courses.size) return no_answer;
