~~ level order traversal ~~

given a positive number n, print first n natural numbers whose digits are either 1 or 2 or 3,
in sorted form.

here, before printing the level order, we confirmed that every level will have data in sorted order
and their value is increasing sequentially from level to level, but this method won't work for
cases where level order is not sorted and have repetation in them.

In this implementation, we are not checking whether queue is empty or not at any point, this do not
lead to any problem because we are pushing more elements than we are popping at every iteration, hence
we are safe, but this will not be true for all problems of this type.

queue<int> q;
q.push(0);
int c = 0;
while (c<n) {
    int x = q.front();
    if (x != 0) {
        cout << x << " ";
        c++;
    }
    q.pop()
    q.push(x*10+1)
    q.push(x*10+2)
    q.push(x*10+3)
}

TC = O(n)
SC = O(n)
