~~ what is a queue ~~

FIFO

it's a two ended data structure

deletion -> front
insertion -> back

struct Queue {
    int arr[]
    int front, back
}

push() {
    back++
    arr[back] = x
}

pop() {
    front++
}

underflow => front > back
overflow => back == arr.size()

in this implementation a lot of space is wasted even when we are indicated that the queue is full,
it may be possible that queue is mostly empty.
