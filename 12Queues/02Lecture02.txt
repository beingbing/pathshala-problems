~~ circular queue ~~

if array is circular
we can achieve it by -
b = (b+1)%n instead of b = b+1, both for front and back indices
n is size of array

overflow/underflow => front = (back+1)%n
so it may create confusion, hence to distinguish between these two conditions
you can keep a 'count' variable and then
overflow => count = n
underflow => count = 0
