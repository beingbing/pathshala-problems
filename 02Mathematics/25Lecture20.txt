~~ pascal triangle for nCr ~~

1. given m girls and n boys, need to choose a group containing t people, having no less
than 4 boys and no less than 1 girl.

so, 5 <= t <= m+n

and,

t => x boys + y girls,      here, 4 <= x and 1 <= y

now, if, 4 <= n <= 30 and 1 <= m <= 30

to calculate nCr, create pascal's triangle

then do the computation

SC = O(m*n) TC = ~~ O(1)
