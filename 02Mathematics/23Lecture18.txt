~~ permutations and combinations ~~

1. there is a bit string of size n, how many different configrations are possible

if n = 3
   _ _ _
   2 2 2

by rule of product 2*2*2 = 2^3




2. Take a set (set only contain unique elements), find count of distinct subsets.

for every element we have 2 choices, either have it or ignore it.

S = {0,1,2} => count of subsets will be 2*2*2 = 2^3, so in general,  2^n

Note: permutations are considered to be the same thing.




3. given a set, how many distinct permutations (different orderings) are possible

here, you can not leave any element, every elements need to be taken into account

S = {0,1,2}

                _       _       _   =>    3*2*1 = !3, so in general  !n
                3       2       1
