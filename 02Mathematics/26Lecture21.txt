~~ Introduction to Catalan numbers ~~

given n, n is number of pair of parentheses, find the number of count of distinct
balanced parentheses combinations with n pair of parentheses.

consider the case -

        (__inside__)  outside

we take one parentheses, and then for remaining N-1 parentheses there are two options
they can either be inside the choosen parentheses or they can be outside. then,
the options we have are -

C0 * C(n-1)  +  C1 * C(n-2)  +  C2 * C(n-3)  +  ......

where,
in first case there are 0 parentheses inside and (n-1) parentheses outside.
in second case there are 1 parentheses inside and (n-2) parentheses outside.
in third case there are 2 parentheses inside and (n-3) parentheses outside.
... goes on

and the final answer will the the sum of all those cases. So, the equation becomes -

        f(n) = {i -> 0, n-1} âˆ‘ (f(i)*f(n-i-1))
where,
f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 1

other formula for this, using combinatorics is -

        f(n) = 2nCn / (n+1)

code -

vector<int> cnt(n+1, 0);
cnt[0] = cnt[1] = 1;
int ans{0};
for (int i{2}; i<=n; i++)
    for (int j{0}; j<i; j++)
        cnt[i] += cnt[j]*cnt[i-j-1];
return cnt[n];
