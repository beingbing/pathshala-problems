~~ open close problems ~~

Problem: N doors which are initially closed, all labeled from [1,N]. You played it N times, and in ith round toggle states of all those doors which are multiple of i. What will be the final state of the doors, how many doors will be open.

Ans:Since doors were initially closed so we need to toggle them odd number of times for them to remain open. Door numbers which has odd number of factors will become open and all the remaining doors will remain closed. And as we know, only perfect squares has odd number of factors, so all the doors numbers in [1,N] which are a perfect square will be open others will remain closed.

But how to find how many perfect squares will be there within range of [1, N].
For that do sqrt of N and discard decimal portion, the result is the count of numbers whose perfect squares are less than N, hence will be found between [1, N]

So, return sqrt(N) as the answer.
