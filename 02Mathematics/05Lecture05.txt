~~ open close problems ~~

N doors which are initially closed, all labelled from [1,N], you played it N times,
and in ith round toggle states of all those doors which are multiple of i. What will
be the final state of the doors, how many doors will be open.

Ans: door numbers which has odd number of factors will become open and all the remaining
doors will remain closed.
And as we know, only perfect squares has odd number of factors, so all the doors numbers
in [1,N] which are a perfect square will be open other remaining will be closed.
so,
  return sqrt(N);
will be the answer.
