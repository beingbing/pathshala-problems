~~ applications of catalan numbers ~~

1. given 2d grid n*n, moment is possible in down or right direction, you are at (0,0) and
need to reach (n-1, n-1), give the count of all possible paths.
(rat in the maze problem - solution using iterative approach)

so, we have only two choices at every step, either move right (R) or move down (D)
and the total number of steps will be (row-1)+(col-1) hence, the size of each answer will be this

so, in other words, we have to find all the valid strings containing R and D which are of size
(row-1)+(col-1). And the rules of validity will be -
    - total(R) in string = row - 1, similarly, total(D) in string = col - 1

so, we just need to pick any row-1 slots and assign them R, so
answer =>  (2n-2)C(n-1)

if m*n matrix => (m+n-2)C(m-1) or (m+n-2)C(n-1)




2. given square matrix, find count of paths from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1) such that you never cross
major diagonal ( go till major diagonal )

approach -
at any time cnt(down moves) >= cnt(right moves)
and, we always have to start with down moves

it is similar to parantheses problem, where we have to start with '(' and count of '(' at any
instant of time should be >=  ')'

so, our problems become => count of balanced parantheses combinations with n-1 parantheses. Which
was our previous problem.

the final answer will be -
f(n-1) = {i -> 0, n-2} âˆ‘ (f(i)*f(n-i-1))
where,
f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 1
