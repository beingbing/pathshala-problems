~~ Primality test ~~

Prime number: A number which has only 2 distinct divisors 1 and itself is called a prime number.

Problem: check if given number n is prime.

Approach 1:
from 1 to N if a number is not divisible by any number, then it is a prime.

TC - O(n)

Approach 2:
if a factor isn't present till sqrt(n), then no factor will be found after it also

TC = O(sqrt(n))

Code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int n) {
    int val = sqrt(n);
    for (int i{2}; i<=val; i++) if (n%i == 0) return false;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    cout << (isPrime(n) ? "Yes, Prime" : "Not a Prime") << endl;
    return 0;
}
