~~ modular arithematic (arithematic of remainders) ~~

a % b = c where b != 0, so c belongs to [0, b-1]

modular congruence => when two numbers give same remainder on modular with b,then
those numbers are said to be in modular congruence.

properties -
1. (a+b)%m = (a%m + b%m) % m
2. (a-b)%m = a%m - b%m          if result a%m - b%m > 0
           = a%m - b%m + m      if result a%m - b%m < 0
3. (a*b)%m = (a%m * b%m) % m

Note: remainder of sum  =  (sum of remainders) % m
