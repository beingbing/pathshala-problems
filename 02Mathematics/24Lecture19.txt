~~ understanding nCr ~~

1. From given n things, need to pick r things randomly, then how many different combinations
of r elements are possible.

e.g -   A B C D E
                        _    _   =>  5*4 choices according to 'rule of product'
                        5    4   
                        choices
but, different combinations means, the order of elements doesn't matter, so if one combination
is AB then it is same as BA, hence, for every possible combinations, there will be a
permutations present which we have to ignore, so in above example every string will have a
permutations which we need to ignore, that means every combinations of two elements can appear
in two ways as in the case of AB and BA, from which we need to consider only 1. So, dividing
the original answer 5*4 by 2 will give us the right answer.

so, generalizing this idea we can say,
                    n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-(r-1))
                    ___________________________
                    r*(r-1)*(r-2)*.......*3*2*1

multiplying by !(n-r) in both numberator and denominator we get,
                       !n
                    _________   => nCr
                    !r !(n-r)




2. Given n bits, find number of distinct bit string of size n that have exactly k 1s.

choose any k slots from available n slots and assign 1 to them. so, answer will be - nCk




3. Given n walls, pick any 3 walls and color them with R, G and B

so, i can choose any 3 walls from n walls in nC3 ways, and all those 3 walls will give
me different permutations of color based on which color i choose for which wall, so, there
will be !3 ways to color the selected walls as well.
hence the answer is,
                    nC3 * !3
