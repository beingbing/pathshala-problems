~~ basics of combinatorics ~~

1. Rule of product

A  3 roads p,q,r  B   2 roads p', q'   C

so to reach from A to C we have 3*2 options
3 distinct ways from A to B, and 2 distinct ways from B to C

generalise -
to complete a particular action A, if we need to do two actions A' and A"
then,
no of ways in which A can be done = no of ways in which A' can be done * no of ways in which A" can be done
