~~ generating all factors/divisors ~~

Problem 1: find all the factors of a given number n.

Discussion:
given a number N its smallest factor will be 1 and its largest factor will be N (number itself). Hence, all the factors of N will lie between 1 and N.

Approach 1:
loop from 1 to N and record all numbers that perfectly divides N.

void printAllDivisorsM1(int n) {
    cout << 1 << '\t';
    for (int i{2}; i<n; i++) {
        if (n%i == 0) cout << i << '\t';
    }
    cout << n << endl;
}

Time Complexity is O(n)

Approach 2:
the biggest factor of N apart from N will be <= (N/2), so, we can reduce the looping limits as -

void printAllDivisorsM2(int n) {
    cout << 1 << '\t';
    for (int i{2}; i<=n/2; i++) {
        if (n%i == 0) cout << i << '\t';
    }
    cout << n << endl;
}

Time Complexity is O(n)

Approach 3:
observation: factors of a number N are symmetric about sqrt(N).
that means if i is a factor then N/i will also be a factor.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printAllDivisorsM3(int n) {
    cout << 1 << '\t';
    int lim = sqrt(n);
    for (int i{2}; i<=lim; i++)
        if (n%i == 0)
            if (i*i == n) cout << i << '\t';
            else cout << i << '\t' << n/i << '\t';
    cout << n << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n = 16;
    printAllDivisorsM3(n);
    return 0;
}

Time Complexity is O(sqrt(n))

Problem 2: given a number return false if it has even number of divisors, otherwise return true

Approach:
perfect squares has odd number of factors and other numbers have even number of factors.

bool oddNumberOfFactors(int n) {
    int val = sqrt(n);
    if (val*val == n) return true;
    return false;
}
