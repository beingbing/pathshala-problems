### Fast Prime Factorization

#### Problem:
You are given a number `n` and `Q` queries. Each query provides a number `x` (where `x ≤ n`), and for each query, you must print the prime factorization of `x`, where each prime appears as many times as it divides `x`.

---

### Approach 1: Trial Division for Each Query

**Explanation:**
For each query, we iterate through numbers from 2 up to `sqrt(x)` to find the prime factors of `x`. This is the basic trial division method, but when handling multiple queries, it becomes inefficient due to repetitive calculations.

**Time Complexity:**
- **O(Q * sqrt(n))** for `Q` queries. Each query can take up to `sqrt(n)` operations to compute the prime factors of `x`.

---

### Approach 2: Using Sieve of Eratosthenes + Trial Division

**Explanation:**
1. Precompute all prime numbers less than `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each query, use only these precomputed primes (up to `sqrt(x)`) to find the prime factorization of `x`.

While this approach reduces the number of unnecessary checks (e.g., skipping non-prime numbers), it still checks primes that may not divide `x`.

**Time Complexity:**
- **O(n log log n)** for preprocessing primes.
- **O(Q * sqrt(n))** for each query, as we still divide by primes up to `sqrt(x)`.

### Approach 3: Precompute Smallest Prime Factors (SPF)

**Optimized Explanation:**
This approach removes unnecessary checks by precomputing the smallest prime factor (SPF) for each number ≤ `n`. The idea is:
1. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to compute the **smallest prime factor** for each number. Every composite number is first marked by its smallest prime factor during the sieve process.
2. For each query, to find the prime factorization of `x`, simply divide `x` by its smallest prime factor repeatedly until `x` becomes 1.

**Key Insight:**
- When factoring a number `x`, we only divide by its smallest prime factor, ensuring that no unnecessary checks for non-divisors or composite numbers occur.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

vector<int> primes, spf; // To store prime status and smallest prime factor (spf)

// Function to compute smallest prime factors (spf) for all numbers <= n
void primesTill(int n) {
    primes.resize(n+1, 1), spf.resize(n+1, -1); // Initialize
    primes[1] = 0; // 1 is not a prime
    int val = sqrt(n); 
    for (int i = 2; i <= val; i++) {
        if (primes[i] == 1) {  // i is prime
            for (int j = i; i * j <= n; j++) {
                if (primes[i * j] == 1) {  // Mark composite number
                    spf[i * j] = i;  // Set smallest prime factor
                    primes[i * j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Function to get prime factors of n using precomputed spf
vector<int> primeFactors(int n) {
    primesTill(n);  // Precompute primes and spf
    vector<int> ans;
    while (spf[n] != -1) {
        ans.push_back(spf[n]);  // Add smallest prime factor
        n /= spf[n];  // Reduce n
    }
    if (n != 1) ans.push_back(n);  // If n itself is prime
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> ans = primeFactors(n);
    for (auto ele : ans) cout << ele << '\t';  // Print prime factors
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Preprocessing (Sieve):** `O(n log log n)` to compute the smallest prime factors for all numbers ≤ `n`.
- **Query Time:** `O(log n)` for each query, since repeatedly dividing `x` by its smallest prime factor reduces `x` logarithmically.

Total complexity: **O(n log log n) + O(Q * log n)** for `n` and `Q` queries.

---

### Key Insights:
1. **Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) Approach:**
    - Precomputing the smallest prime factor of each number ensures that no unnecessary checks are made during queries.
    - For each query, you can directly divide the number by its smallest prime factor until it reduces to 1, ensuring that the factorization is computed in logarithmic time.

2. **Efficiency:**
    - This approach is particularly efficient for multiple queries. With preprocessing taking `O(n log log n)` and each query handled in `O(log n)`, it outperforms methods that check each number individually up to `sqrt(x)`.
