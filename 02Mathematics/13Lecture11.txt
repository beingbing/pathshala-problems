~~ counting divisors faster ~~

given a number N, give count of the divisors of N.


M1 -

N can be represented in terms of it's prime factors as -

        N = p^l * q^m * r^n * .....

its divisor will be -

        d = p^i * q*j * r*k * .....
where,
        0 <= i <= l
        0 <= j <= m
        0 <= k <= n ....

so, count of total divisors will be -
    (l+1)*(m+1)*(n+1)* .....
