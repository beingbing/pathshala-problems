~~ Isolation property: transaction schedules ~~

If different threads are running different transactions which are worked on the same DB. Then how to
ensure Isolation so that one transaction doesn't affect other transaction.

for that we defined -
Schedules: a series of instructions that are happening in multiple transactions in sequential order.

We need to make sure that every schedule is valid, hence we need a way to check validity of a schedule
if that is done then we are good to go.

so, what kind of schedule do we actually require -
ans,
serial schedule: if multiple transactions are bound to happen then they happen completely in a serial
order.

# Equivalent schedules -
two schedules are called equivalent if their effect/impact(final result) is same.

To ensure isolation, what we need to make sure is that the schedule in which the actual transaction
occur is equivalent schedule to one of the serial schedule.

To check this equivalence, there are multiple ways -
- checking conflict serialisability
- checking view serialisability
