## üîÑ Conflict Serializability (CS)

Conflict Serializability ensures that even if multiple transactions are interleaved, the final outcome remains the same as if they were executed one after another ‚Äî i.e., in **some serial order**.

To check this, we analyze **conflicts** between operations across transactions.

### üß® When Do Conflicts Occur?

Conflicts only happen when:
- Two **different transactions** access the **same data item**
- **At least one** of the accesses is a **write**

| Operation Pair        | Conflict? | Reason                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `read(A)` & `read(A)` | ‚ùå No     | Both just reading ‚Äî no problem           |
| `read(A)` & `write(A)`| ‚úÖ Yes    | One writes, may affect what the other reads |
| `write(A)` & `read(A)`| ‚úÖ Yes    | Same as above, order matters             |
| `write(A)` & `write(A)`| ‚úÖ Yes   | Overwrites may happen in wrong order     |

### üîÅ Conflict Equivalence

Two schedules are **conflict equivalent** if:
- They involve the **same operations**
- The **order of conflicting operations** is the same

üëâ You can transform one into another using **only non-conflicting swaps** of adjacent operations.

If a schedule `S` is conflict equivalent to some **serial schedule**, we say:

> **S is Conflict Serializable**

### üß™ Conflict Serializability Test

Let‚Äôs understand with a simple example:

```
Schedule S:           Schedule S‚Ä≤ (serial):
T1: read(A)           T1: read(A)
T1: write(A)          T1: write(A)
T2: read(A)           T1: read(B)
T2: write(A)          T1: write(B)
T1: read(B)           T2: read(A)
T1: write(B)          T2: write(A)
T2: read(B)           T2: read(B)
T2: write(B)          T2: write(B)
```

- `S` can be transformed into serial schedule `S‚Ä≤` via **non-conflicting adjacent swaps**
- Therefore, `S` is **conflict serializable**

---

### üß† Key Idea

If you can reorder a schedule to form a serial schedule by only swapping non-conflicting operations, the schedule is **conflict serializable**.

This guarantees **isolation** ‚Äî even though operations are interleaved, the result is the same as a clean, serial run.

### ‚ùì So, how to check if a given schedule is conflict serializable?

‚û°Ô∏è **Construct a Precedence Graph (also called Serialization Graph):**
1. Create a **node for each transaction**
2. For each conflict, draw a **directed edge**:
   - From T‚ÇÅ to T‚ÇÇ if an operation in T‚ÇÅ **conflicts** with and **precedes** an operation in T‚ÇÇ

‚úîÔ∏è If the graph has **no cycles** ‚Üí the schedule is **conflict serializable**  
‚ùå If there is a **cycle** ‚Üí the schedule is **not conflict serializable**
