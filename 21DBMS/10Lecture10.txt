~~ Joins in SQL ~~

when we take two tables and try to join them based on a certain column. For that have have to have
a common column between them.

every row of table1 will be tried with every row of table2 and if their common column value matches
then that row will be printed.

e.g. -
SELECT * FROM Topics JOIN Videos ON Topics.TID = Videos.TID WHERE name = 'arrays';

# types of join -
- inner join (regular join)
do not give preferential treatment to any side.
if table1 contain TID7 but table2 do not contain, then TID7 will not be present in final table.
similarly, if table1 do not contain TID7 but table2 contain, then TID7 will not be present in final table. 

- left join
SELECT * FROM Topics LEFT JOIN Videos ON Topics.TID = Videos.TID WHERE name = 'arrays';
if table1 contain TID7 but table2 do not contain, then TID7 will be present in final table with empty values.
so, left join give preferential treatment to left table.

- right join
similar to left join, right join gives preferential treatment to right table.

- outer join
it gives preferential treatment to both sides.
if table1 contain TID7 but table2 do not contain, then TID7 will be present in final table with empty values.
similarly, if table1 do not contain TID7 but table2 contain, then TID7 will be present in final table with empty values.

- natural join
we will not right ON clause. We will let the table merge automatically on the basis of common column.
use it carefully, if there are more than 1 column with common names in those two tables then it will try to join
on the basis of all those columns.
