~~ functional dependencies ~~

X                   --->                Y
subset of                           subset of
table columns                       table columns

functional dependency: if for two rows r1 and r2, values of X is same then it implies that values of Y will also be same.

so, X determines Y, but it is not necessary that vice versa is also true.

these functional dependencies makes candidate keys legit. Hence, we can say,
candidate keys      ---->       everything else in a row of a table.
                    determines
theses are of two types -
- trivial dependencies
if X -> Y then Y is a subset of X

- non trivial dependencies
if X -> Y then Y is not a subset of X
