~~ introduction to DBMS ~~

data: any raw input, e.g. - samar, cohor4, 200

information: writing a complete sentence using that data. (processed data)

knowledge: conclusion based on information.

we store data in our database management system

DBMS: software that will maintain, manipulate, manages and stores the data.

whatever software written over DBMS, it runs some query on it to get some information.

knowledge is totally derived by user.

why DBMS ?

other alternatives -
- maintain data in memory.
as RAM is volatile in nature, and we might not want to loss it.

- maintain data in files.
    - complex to retrieve information from stored data.
    - for even a simple change in retrieval, we need to re-write a chunck of code.
    - very slow in terms of time.
    - securit issue.

so we cant have either data in RAM nor in files. and also we want a system with easier data
retrieval system.

this is where DBMS comes into picture. it's whole job is to maintain and give easy access to data.
