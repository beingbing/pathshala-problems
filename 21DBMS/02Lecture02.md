## 🧬 Evolution of Database Usage in Software

### 🖥️ Phase 1: Enterprise Software (Standalone Systems)

Early software systems (like **cash register machines**) ran entirely on a single machine, including the database.

- The **database was stored locally**—often as flat files or embedded DBs.
- Everything (processing + data) was self-contained within the device.

#### ✅ Advantages:
- **Better data control** – since data never leaves the machine.
- **No internet dependency** – works even when offline.

#### ❌ Drawbacks:
- **Storage limitations** – limited by the device’s memory and disk size.
- **Maintenance challenges** – installing updates or fixing issues required on-site technicians.
- **Dependency on client hardware/software** – behavior could vary across machines.
- **Security risk** – users had full access to local data; trust in the client was essential.

### 🌐 Phase 2: Web & App-Based Systems (Client-Server Architecture)

Modern systems shifted to a **client-server model**, where the client (app or browser) interacts with a central server that handles all data operations.

#### 🧩 Architecture:

```
Client (Frontend/UI)
     ↕
     ↔ API Calls ↔
     ↕
Server (Backend/Business Logic)
     ↕
Database (Centralized Data Store)
```

- The **client is "dumb"**—it simply sends requests and shows results.
- The **server processes requests**, interacts with the **central DB**, and sends processed data back.

#### ✅ Benefits:
- **Centralized data** – easier to maintain, update, and back up.
- **Cross-device consistency** – same data and behavior across all users.
- **Easy deployment** – no client-side installations or technician visits.

#### ❌ New Challenges:
- **Performance depends on network** – poor internet = poor user experience.
- **Security & privacy** – third-party servers store and process sensitive user data.
- **Need for expert maintenance** – DB admins, server ops, and DevOps teams are essential.
