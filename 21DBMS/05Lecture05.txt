~~ types of relations ~~

these types are based on cardinality.

cardinality: how two entities are related, there are 4 types -

one - one
one - many
many - one
many - many

# representation of above relations in ER diagram
one : represented by an arrow (emerging from relation and colliding into entity)
many: represented by an undirected line

# roles associated with relationships
each connection has a role associated with it, so that we are able to more clearly define the relation
established

# partial or total participation of an entity in a relationship
- subcategories normally participate totally and super-categories partially in a relationship.
total Participation: represented by a double line.
partial participation: represented by a single line.

# nature of relationship
it's always not necessary that relationships are binary in nature. (binary: only two entities participate).
Relationships can have higher degree (like ternary, quaternary, etc.) as well.
(always try to keep relationships binary though, it is advantageous).
