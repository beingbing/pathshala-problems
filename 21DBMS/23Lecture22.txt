~~ boyce codd normal form ~~

Example:
gradeInfo table with rows -
rNo, name, email, grade, courseName, marks

candidate keys -> (rNo, email), (name, email), (rNo, name)

both 2NF and 3NF is followed, but still there is redundancy w.r.t. name and email.

this is where BCNF kicks in,
any functional dependency in table must be of the form, key -> anything else.
so, nothing except key should be able to determine a row uniquely.
and if that is happening then we need to put all those rows in another table with candidate key as that tables primary key as well.

Note: sometimes, it happens that, we intentionally need to violate some of these 4 normal forms. 

Dependency preservation: decomposition of a table should preserve functional dependency

IF a BCNF decomposition is not preserving dependencies which were present in original table then we refrain from doing such
decomposition.
