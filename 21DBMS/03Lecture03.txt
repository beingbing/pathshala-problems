~~ types of database ~~

two kinds of DB -
- relational DBMS (everything is modelled as a table) (every noun is a table) (more efficient) (preferred)
- non-relational DBMS

generally, if you have a defined structure of your data, then go for relational DBMS.

non-relational DBMS -
- key value store (e.g. - cache) (product: redis)
- graph DBMS (e.g. - neo4j) (product: facebook, linkedin)
- time series DBMS (e.g. - prometheus) (product: uber (position of taxi with time))
- document based DBMS (e.g. - mongoDB, casandra): unstructured json stored in document
(product: amazon (information of a product to be sold))
