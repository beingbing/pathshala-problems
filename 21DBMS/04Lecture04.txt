~~ entity relationship diagram ~~

how to structure information in tables of a given problem.

before designing a table we create ER diagram.

problem: design renaissance dashboard
- sections
    - module inside sections
        - videos
        - assignments/HW - questions
- users make payments
- payment is on subscription model
- user watch videos (we track %)
- user submit code for questions - verdict

Entity: objects identified in problem statement

objects (nouns) -
- sections
- modules
- videos
- assignments/HW
- questions
- payments
- users
- subscription model
- submissions
- verdict

attributes: information (data) that we need to store about each entity.

- questions: difficulty level, ID, name, link, author
- users: email, phoneNumber, name, college, graduation year

types of attributes -
- simple attributes (email)
- composite attributes (fullName = firstName + lastName)
- derived attributes (% problems solved => problems solved / total problems * 100)

categorisation of attributes -
- single valued attributes (college name)
- multi valued attributes (phoneNumber)
- null valued attributes (if value is nullable, e.g. - middle name)

Relationship: it is something that links two entities
- user makes payment.
- topics will have videos

how to model them in a diagram

- entities goes into rectangular boxes
- attributes goes into oval boxes
- relationship between two entities is made using a diamond shaped box.
* relationship can have attributes as well, e.g. - user makes payment, makes can have 'time'
as attribute.
