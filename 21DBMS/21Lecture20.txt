~~ second normal form ~~

Any functional dependencies of a table should not be of following form -
X --(determines)--> Y and X is a subset of K and Y is a non prime attribute.

Prime: part of atleast one candidate key.
non-prime: not part of any candidate key.

example:
user-payment table with rows
UID, name, email, PID, Pdate, Pamount

candidate keys {K}
UID -> name, email
PID -> pdate, Pamount

then its a bad design, because a subset of candidate key should not be able to determine any subset of rows uniquely.
hence, there should be a decomposition and we should make it into separate tables: user table and payment table.

and, here one-many relationship is between user-payment so, payment table should have a foreign key for UID.
