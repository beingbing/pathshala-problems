~~ database evolution in software ~~

- enterprise softwares - runs separately on a machine.
e.g. - cashier machine.
it has an in-machine DB which maintains data for all the things which have been bought.

benifits -
- security of data

problem -
- amount of data totally depends on machine size.
- also dependent on other softwares installed on machine.
- new updates of software installed need to be managed.
- technitian team will be involved.
- trust had to be maintained on the client.

- apps/websites
no data on client machine, 
it follows client-server architecture.

client      ------>         server          ------>             DB
(dumb)      <------      (API)              <------

although it resolves many of the problems introduced by above in-machine softwares, but it
introduces a lot of problem of its own, like,
- it is slower and depends upon internet connectivity.
- privacy/security issues, as a third-party is maintaining and managing our data for us.
- third parties need DB administrators to manage them.
