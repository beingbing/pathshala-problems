~~ third normal form ~~

transitive dependencies:
if X --(determines)--> Y is a functional dependency and there exist Z such that X --(determines)--> Z and Z --(determines)--> Y
then X->Y is a transitive dependency.

3NF: If relation is in 2NF and a non prime attribute is not transitively dependent on a candidate key, then table is in 3NF.

If we find a 3NF in a table then make a separate table for XY and YZ.

There are some cases which are missed by all these 3 normal forms, for that we will study a new rule in next lecture.
