~~ rooted and unrooted trees ~~

rooted trees: root is fixed.
in an undirected tree we can choose any node and do DFS traversal (like we use to do in BT) and will
able to traverse the complete tree.

If root changes, then height of tree changes as well.
but diameter of a tree remains unchanged.
because, for height, reference point is root, but diameter considers all the points.
