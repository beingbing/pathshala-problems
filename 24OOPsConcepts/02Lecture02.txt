~~ a basic intro to class ~~

as seen in last lecture we need to separate out code with independent standing in a separate file,
and to help with that we can use Class

class -> helps us to put related data and algorithm together as a separate independently standing
unit (entity).

e.g. - in file-system, a file can be thought of an entity.

so, whenever you think of entity, think of class, and they can be interdependent on each other as well.
