~~ encapsulation ~~

direct access to instance variable must not be allowed. Data must be hidden.
All instance variables must be private and their getters must be public.

sometimes you do not want a getter for some properties, you just want it to keep a secret
internally known to the class only. 

changes are not always backward compatible.
