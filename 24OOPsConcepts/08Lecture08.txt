~~ this keyword ~~

it is used for self refrencing. You reference the current object in action. Inside of a class you can access the said object
using this keyword.

this has the same hashCode as the pointer to the object which is contained in heap memory.

can not use this keyword from static methods.

this can be used to access constructors as well.
if constructor is Student()
then this can be envoked as this()
if constructor is Student(int a, int b)
then this can be envoked as this(int a, int b)

by using this we can do constructor chaining, that is, call one constructor inside another as mentioned above.

using this we can pass the current class instance from one class to another.
this apporach is very effective when we try to do event handling, we can pass around the whole object and then it's upto
the method to which the object is passed, it can consume the object however way it wants.

method chaining -
a member method after modifiying the object, return this, to return the new modified object to another method.
e.g. -
obj.func1().func2().func3();
here func1, func2 does return this; after modification.
