~~ polymorphism ~~

Interface -
- skeleton of a class
- interface is all about behaviour/methods

polymorphism is a concept and interface is a construct which is used to implement/achieve that concept.

in lecture, an animal interface was defined with walk() and speak(), then 3 different class were written which implements that
interface, namely, cat and dog class, the objects of which were stored in an array of type animal, then another class was written
which iterates over that array of animal and execute their speak();

this is an example of plug-and-play model, where you can create a class of any type of animal like giraffe, elephant etc, and
store its object in animal array, on which our tester class loops and executes speak() for all the animals.

so, polymorphism helps us in achieving 2 things -
- it helps us define a generic structure for multiple similar kind of applications
- poly means many and morphs mean forms, so a generic kind of data type can store different type of objects, here in our example,
we saw that animal array was able to store all cat, dog, giraffe and elephant objects.

runtime polymorphism -
during runtime objects are created and provided to variable.
