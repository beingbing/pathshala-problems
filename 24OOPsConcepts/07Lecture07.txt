~~ all about constructors ~~

constructor contains name of class, it does not return anything.

it is required to construct instances of a class, we write initialisation activity in a constructor.

new keyword is must while invoking a constructor.

an object is always created in heap memory. The variable which references that object stays in RAM, it works as pointer
and points to the object sitting in heap memory.
so, the name which we give to an object, is not an object in itself, its a pointer to an object.

default constructor -> if we do not write a constructor, then a no arguments constructor is provided by compiler to us.
DC is provided to you if and only if you have not written any constructor of your own.
hence, you will have to do constructor overloading.

Note: builder DP is used in constructor overloading to prevent constructor explosion.

copy constructor -> copies the value of one object into the object which is being created.
