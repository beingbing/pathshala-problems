~~ runtime vs compile-time polymorphism ~~

runtime -> something that happens after compilation, when the program is alive and in action. 

runtime polymorphism -> call to a method is resolved at runtime, not at compile-time.

method overloading => compile-time polymorphism

implicit type promotion => similar to type casting

can main() be overloaded ?
