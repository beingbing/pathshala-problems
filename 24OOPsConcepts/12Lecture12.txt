~~ generic sorting using polymorphism ~~

anonymous class -> when you try to instatiate an interface, then it will tell you to define
the methods there and then, which will function as an anonymous class.

we use anonymous classes mostly when we know that the code by which we will be declaring it
will not be used again, it is like inline/anonymous functions in javasript (or like anonymous
callback functions)

in this lecture a generic sort class is created which takes in a comparator object and on the basis
of which it does sorting, so for that we implemented three comparator classes namely,
ascendingComparator, descendingComparator and absoluteValueComparator and passed their objects
in sort class to do the sorting.
