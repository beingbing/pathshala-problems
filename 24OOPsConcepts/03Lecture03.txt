~~ a basic intro to objects ~~

declaring and defining a class is not enough, for creating an object you need to provide memory to its instance
which can be done by new keyword.

File     myfile    =   new   File()
type variable-name   keyword constructor

every instance of a class has its own set of properties. We use dot operator to run the methods of that class
on instances. All of objects of the same class has the same methods. Methods may behave differently on different
objects, because different objects have different data.
