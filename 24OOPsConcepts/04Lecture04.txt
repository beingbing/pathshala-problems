~~ access modifiers ~~

private -> something which is not disclosed to others. If a property/method is declared private then it can only be accessed inside of a
class it cannot be accessed outside using dot operator. 

public ->

protected -> when something is declared as protected, then it has public scope for classes which are in same package but private scope
for classes which are outside of their package. but, this rule is exempted for child classes.
so, if there is a variable in a classwhich is protected but we have a child class in another package which extends our class then that
child class will be able to access the variable.

Note: if you do not provide any access modifiers to a property/method then it is public for classes in the same package but private
outside the package.
