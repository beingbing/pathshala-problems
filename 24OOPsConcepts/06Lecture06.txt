~~ static methods ~~

a static method can also be accessed from object. But to create an instance only to use its static
methods is futile.

If everything in a class is static then we can enforce user to not create an instance of that class
by making the constructor private.

If your method is static then you can not talk to non-static variables/methods from defination of
that method, but reverse is allowed.

static variables -> initialised during class loadig process
