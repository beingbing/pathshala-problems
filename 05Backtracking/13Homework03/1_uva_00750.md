To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that they do not attack each other horizontally or diagonally. Given that the queens are already in different columns, the only possible moves involve shifting queens vertically (changing their row position).

### Key Insights
1. **Valid Placement in Each Column**: Since each queen is already in a unique column, we only need to ensure that each queen is in a row where it does not conflict with others horizontally or diagonally.
2. **Goal as an Optimization Problem**: This problem can be reduced to finding the minimum number of moves needed to transform the current configuration into a valid N-Queens configuration (no two queens attack each other in any direction).
3. **Using Known Solutions of the 8-Queens Problem**: For an 8x8 board, there are only 92 unique valid configurations (solutions to the N-Queens problem), which can be precomputed. For each test case, compare the given board setup with each of the 92 configurations, calculating the number of moves required to match each valid configuration. The result for that test case will be the minimum of these move counts.
4. **Heuristic of Minimizing Moves**: Calculate the moves for each configuration by determining the number of vertical moves needed to match each queenâ€™s row to that of a queen in a valid configuration.

### Steps to Approach the Problem
1. **Precompute Valid N-Queens Configurations**:
    - Generate all 92 valid solutions for the 8-Queens problem.
    - Each configuration will be an array of 8 integers, where each integer represents the row position of the queen in each column.

2. **For Each Test Case**:
    - Calculate the minimum number of moves required to transform the given board configuration to match each valid configuration.
    - For each configuration, the number of moves is the sum of the moves needed to align each queen to the row in the valid configuration.

3. **Return the Minimum Move Count**:
    - The result for each test case is the minimum move count across all valid configurations.

### Probable Pitfalls
1. **Handling Large Input Efficiently**:
    - With up to 1000 test cases, ensure that the algorithm checks configurations efficiently and avoids unnecessary recalculations by leveraging precomputed configurations.
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Cases where queens are in the same row initially require many moves to resolve.
    - Valid configurations with minimal moves may not always be unique.

### Why the Algorithm Is Designed This Way
By precomputing valid configurations, we convert the problem from an exhaustive search to a simple comparison, which significantly reduces the time complexity. The solution only requires summing the moves for each configuration and selecting the minimum.

### Edge Cases
1. **All Queens in the Same Row**: This would require 7 moves to spread them out.
2. **Already Valid Configuration**: If the input matches one of the valid configurations, no moves are needed.

### Developing Intuition
This problem is about reducing unnecessary recalculations by transforming it into a matching problem, leveraging precomputed solutions to reduce complexity.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EightQueensSolver {
    private static final List<int[]> validConfigurations = new ArrayList<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        generateValidConfigurations(new int[8], 0);

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int caseNumber = 1;
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            int[] currentConfig = new int[8];
            for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
                currentConfig[i] = scanner.nextInt() - 1; // Convert 1-based input to 0-based
            }

            int minMoves = findMinimumMoves(currentConfig);
            System.out.println("Case " + caseNumber + ": " + minMoves);
            caseNumber++;
        }
        scanner.close();
    }

    // Generate all valid 8-queens configurations
    private static void generateValidConfigurations(int[] positions, int column) {
        if (column == 8) {
            validConfigurations.add(positions.clone());
            return;
        }

        for (int row = 0; row < 8; row++) {
            if (isSafe(positions, column, row)) {
                positions[column] = row;
                generateValidConfigurations(positions, column + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if placing a queen at (column, row) is safe
    private static boolean isSafe(int[] positions, int column, int row) {
        for (int col = 0; col < column; col++) {
            int otherRow = positions[col];
            if (otherRow == row || Math.abs(otherRow - row) == Math.abs(col - column)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Calculate the minimum moves to match the current configuration to any valid one
    private static int findMinimumMoves(int[] currentConfig) {
        int minMoves = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int[] validConfig : validConfigurations) {
            int moves = 0;
            for (int col = 0; col < 8; col++) {
                if (currentConfig[col] != validConfig[col]) {
                    moves++;
                }
            }
            minMoves = Math.min(minMoves, moves);
        }
        return minMoves;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **generateValidConfigurations**:
    - Recursively generates all valid solutions for the 8-Queens problem and stores them in `validConfigurations`.

2. **isSafe**:
    - Checks if a queen can be placed at `(column, row)` without being attacked by previously placed queens, ensuring a valid 8-Queens configuration.

3. **findMinimumMoves**:
    - For each test case configuration, iterates over all valid configurations and calculates the number of moves required to match the test case configuration to each valid configuration. The minimum move count is returned.

4. **Main Function**:
    - Reads input and processes each test case by calculating the minimum moves required, then printing the result in the specified format.

### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Generating valid configurations is done once and is \(O(8!)\), or approximately \(40,320\), which is manageable.
    - For each test case, comparing against 92 valid configurations takes \(O(92 \times 8) = O(736)\), which is efficient even for 1000 test cases.

2. **Space Complexity**:
    - Storing 92 configurations with 8 integers each requires minimal space, making this approach memory-efficient.

This solution is optimal, leveraging precomputed solutions and minimizing recalculations, ensuring it performs well even with a large number of test cases.
