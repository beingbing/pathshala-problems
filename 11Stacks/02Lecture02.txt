~~ two stacks in same array ~~

implement two stacks within same array

using same array but with two top variables running in opposite direction on opposite ends of array.
All the operaitions will be separately available for both top variables.

stack has a free end and a fixed end, every operation is available only for free end.

struct stack {
    int a[n]
    int top1 = -1, top2 = n
}

stack1
push1 top1++
pop1 top1--

stack2
push2 top2--
pop2 top2++

to detect overflow in this implementation, occurs when both top1 and top2 variables are already
standing side by side.
This overflow situation will be common for both the stacks.
