~~ creation of processes ~~

diving deep into new process and how it comes into be in new-state -

- only existing processes can spawn a new process.

- scheduler process "sched" with PID = 0, which is the root of our process tree.
all new processes gets spawn from some process already present in this tree and become a child of that
process.

sched-process spawn init-process which has PID = 1. and then init spawns other needed processes.

when a process gets spawned, there is no control transfer from parent to child instead all active
processes run parallely.

but sometimes parents can call wait() system call if they want to wait for child to executed and end 
completely, so that other remaining work can be done.


How is a process able to spawn a new process ?
system call fork() lets a process create a clone of itself, after that exec() system call is made by
newly spawn child, it lets the process change the behaviour of itself to whatever it desires.
