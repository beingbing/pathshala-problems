### Introduction to Operating Systems  

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as a bridge between hardware and software, enabling programs to run efficiently on a computer.

But why should we understand how an OS works, even though we rarely write one ourselves?  
- It helps us understand how code executes at a deeper level.  
- It explains how an OS manages multiple tasks across processor cores.  
- It's a key topic for technical interviews, especially for freshers.  
- Knowledge of shell scripting (Bash) is essential for automation and system operations.  

### Course Outline  

1. **Core Functions of an OS** – Managing resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.  
2. **CPU Virtualization** – How the OS creates and manages processes, their states, and execution.  
3. **Memory Management** – Virtual memory, paging algorithms, and efficient process scheduling.  
4. **Concurrency & Synchronization** – Concepts of threads, process coordination, and classic problems like:  
   - Reader-Writer Problem  
   - Dining Philosophers Problem  
5. **Concurrency Bugs & Deadlocks** – Understanding deadlocks and strategies to prevent them.  

By the end of this course, you'll gain a structured understanding of how an OS operates under the hood, helping you write more efficient code and tackle OS-related interview questions with confidence.
