### 💥 Introduction to Deadlocks
In multitasking systems, processes often compete for shared, limited resources (like printers, memory, or files). A deadlock occurs when a group of processes get stuck, each waiting for resources held by the others, and none can proceed. This leads to system slowdown, performance drops, resource wastage or complete system hangs.

### ✅ **Necessary Conditions for Deadlock**
For a deadlock to occur, all four following condition must occur simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource is **non-shareable** — only one process can use it at a time.

2. **Hold and Wait**: A process is holding at least one resource while **waiting** to acquire others.

3. **No Preemption**: A resource **cannot be forcibly taken** from a process; it must be released voluntarily.

4. **Circular Wait**: A cycle of processes exists, where each is waiting for a resource held by the next. Example: `P1 → P2 → ... → Pn → P1`

### 🧯 Strategies to handle Deadlock
Depending on system goals and context, deadlocks can be tackled at different stages. There are four broad strategies for handling deadlocks. Each one deals with the problem at a different stage:

#### 1. **Deadlock Prevention**
**Idea:** Proactively **block at least one** of the four necessary conditions.
**Examples:**
- Disallow *hold and wait*: Force processes to request all resources at once.
- Allow *preemption*: Let the system forcibly reclaim resources.
- Impose a strict *resource ordering*: Processes must request resources in a pre-defined order to prevent circular wait.

> ✅ **Result**: Deadlocks are made **impossible by design**.  
> ❗ **Trade-off**: May reduce resource utilization and flexibility.

#### 2. **Deadlock Avoidance**
**Idea:** Dynamically decide whether to grant a resource based on whether the system will **remain in a safe state**.
- Requires **advance knowledge** of maximum resource needs.
- Popular technique: **Banker’s Algorithm**
    - Grants resources only if the system remains deadlock-free after allocation.

> ✅ **Result**: Deadlocks are **avoided**.  
> ❗ **Trade-off**: Overhead of maintaining safe state checks.

#### 3. **Deadlock Detection and Recovery**
**Idea:** Allow deadlocks to happen, but **detect and recover** from them.

- Use **resource allocation graphs** or **wait-for graphs** to detect cycles.
- **Recovery** techniques:
    - Abort one or more processes.
    - Preempt and roll back resources.

> ✅ **Result**: System can **recover** from deadlocks.  
> ❗ **Trade-off**: May disrupt running processes and require rollback mechanisms.

#### 4. **Deadlock Ignorance**
**Idea:** Simply **ignore** the problem.  
Used in many general-purpose OSes like Windows or Linux for non-critical systems.

- Based on the assumption that deadlocks are **rare**.
- Users may manually restart the system or application if it freezes.

> ✅ **Result**: Zero system overhead.  
> ❗ **Risk**: System hangs if a deadlock occurs (a real possibility).  
> 🪶 This is humorously called the **Ostrich Algorithm** — pretend nothing's wrong.
