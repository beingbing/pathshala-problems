### **Problem of Synchronization**  

Synchronization issues arise when **concurrent threads share data**. This can lead to **race conditions**, where multiple threads attempt to read and modify a variable simultaneously without knowing about each other's actions.

### **Race Condition: The Core Problem**  

A **race condition** occurs when:  
âœ… Multiple threads access and modify a shared resource **at the same time**.  
âœ… The final result **depends on the order of execution**, which is unpredictable.  

**Example:**  
Imagine two threads trying to update a bank balance at the same time.  
- Thread 1 reads balance = **$1000**  
- Thread 2 reads balance = **$1000**  
- Both add **&dollar;500** and store balance as **&dollar;1500** (instead of **$2000**).  

Since **both read before writing**, one update is lost!

### **Critical Section & The Need for Mutual Exclusion**  

The **critical section** is the part of the code where shared data is accessed or modified. If multiple threads enter this section **simultaneously**, inconsistencies occur.  

ðŸ’¡ **Solution? Enforce Mutual Exclusion**  
- **Mutual exclusion** ensures that only **one thread** can enter the critical section at a time.  
- This prevents race conditions and ensures data consistency.  

Mutual exclusion leads to **atomicity**, where operations occur as a single **indivisible** step. If a process starts modifying a variable, it must **finish** before another process can interfere.

### **Why is Synchronization Important?**  
âœ” Prevents data corruption in **banking, databases, and multi-threaded applications**.  
âœ” Ensures **predictable execution** in concurrent programs.  
âœ” Forms the foundation for **thread safety** in modern OS and software.
