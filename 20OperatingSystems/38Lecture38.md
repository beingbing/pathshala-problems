## 🧮 Banker’s Algorithm — Deadlock Avoidance with Multiple Resource Instances

### 🎯 The Goal

Banker’s Algorithm is a deadlock **avoidance** strategy used when:

- There are **multiple instances** of each resource.
- Processes may request resources **dynamically over time**.

> 🛡️ **Idea:** Never grant a resource request that could lead to an **unsafe state** — where deadlock *might* happen.

---

## 🏗️ Key Concepts & Data Structures

Let’s say we have:
- `n` processes
- `m` types of resources

### 📦 Each Process Must Declare:
- **Maximum need**:  
  A matrix `max[n][m]` → maximum instances of each resource a process may need.

### 📦 System Maintains:
- **Allocation matrix** `allocated[n][m]`:  
  Current allocation of resources to processes.
- **Available array** `available[m]`:  
  Number of free instances of each resource.
- **Need matrix** `need[n][m]`:  
  Remaining resources required by each process.

  ```
  need[i][j] = max[i][j] - allocated[i][j]
  ```

## 🧪 Safe State: The Core Idea

A system is in a **safe state** if there exists at least **one sequence** of processes (a "safe sequence") such that:

> Each process can get its remaining needs fulfilled using currently available resources + resources freed by previously completed processes.

If no such sequence exists, the system is in an **unsafe state** — not necessarily in a deadlock, but potentially heading toward one.

---

## 🔍 Example 1 — Safe State

### `need` matrix:

```
     r0  r1
p0   10   1
p1    4   1
p2    9   1
```

### `allocated` matrix:

```
     r0  r1
p0    5   0
p1    2   0
p2    2   0
```

### `available` array:

```
r0  r1
12   1
```

### ✅ Safe Sequence Exists

If all processes request their maximum at once:
- Start with `p1` (needs `2,1`, available = `12,1`)
- After completion, it releases its allocated resources → available becomes `14,1`
- Now `p0` can finish, then `p2`.

➡️ **Safe Sequence:** `p1 → p0 → p2`  
➡️ System is in a **safe state** ✅

---

## 🔄 Example 2 — Unsafe State

Let’s change the allocation:

### `allocated` matrix (updated):

```
     r0  r1
p0    5   1
p1    2   0
p2    2   0
```

### `available` array (same):

```
r0  r1
12   1
```

Now:
- `p0` needs `5,0`, `p1` needs `2,1`, `p2` needs `7,1`
- Only `p1` might proceed, but even after that, not enough resources for `p0` or `p2`

➡️ No valid sequence to fulfill all needs  
➡️ **Unsafe state** ❌ (Deadlock is possible)

## 👨‍💻 Banker’s Algorithm Steps

```cpp
// Given:
int max[n][m];        // Max resources each process may need
int allocated[n][m];  // Resources currently allocated
int available[m];     // Currently available instances

// Step 1: Calculate need matrix
int need[n][m];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
        need[i][j] = max[i][j] - allocated[i][j];

// Step 2: Initialize finished[] as false
bool finished[n] = {false};
int safeSequence[n];  // Optional: to store the safe sequence
int count = 0;

// Step 3: Try to find a safe sequence
while (count < n) {
    bool found = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!finished[i]) {
            int j;
            for (j = 0; j < m; j++)
                if (need[i][j] > available[j])
                    break;

            if (j == m) { // All resources can be allocated
                for (int k = 0; k < m; k++)
                    available[k] += allocated[i][k];

                safeSequence[count++] = i;
                finished[i] = true;
                found = true;
            }
        }
    }

    if (!found) break; // No process could proceed
}

// Step 4: Check final result
if (count == n) {
    // Safe state
    print("Safe Sequence: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        print("P" + safeSequence[i]);
} else {
    print("System is in an UNSAFE state");
}
```
