~~ introduction to deadlocks ~~

deadlock was already explained in last lecture.

due to introduction of deadlock, CPU gets slowed down.

so, now lets discuss on its resolution -

condition for deadlock to occur -
- there is a mutually exclusive resource
If p1 has r1 and p2 wants r1 then p2 must wait for p1 to release it.

- hold and wait
there are some processes which are holding some resources and waiting for some other resources.

- there should be no pre-emption.
process cant release acquired resources before completion.

- circular waiting
p1 is holding r1 and waiting for r2
p2 is holding r2 and waiting for r1

different ways of dealing with deadlock is -

- prevention
they will not allow atleast one of these 4 conditions to happen.
they have checks in place to ensure that.

- avoidance
they try to detect that deadlock is about to happen and avoid it.

- detect deadlock and recover from it.
they detect that a deadlock has happened then tries to recover from it.

- ignore deadlock
let CPU get slowed due to it, then user will automatically restart the machine and everything
will be as new again.
