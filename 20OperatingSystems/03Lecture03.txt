~~ CPU virtualization ~~

resources required a computer to run -
- CPU
- memory/RAM
- HDD/DB/files

any program requires CPU to run. but a CPU can run a single program at a time, so, we should be able to
execute a single program at a time, but that doesn't happen, because of a concept of cores. Each core
can separately operate a program, and we have multiple cores in our CPU. But the no of cores doesnt
dictate the number of programs that can be run at a time. Due to concept of virtualization, we can
run infinite programs at any given time. That's because, CPU keeps switching between different programs
and it does this very quickly. So a single core runs a single program at a time but switching is so
fast that it feels like there are multiple programs being handled at a time.
