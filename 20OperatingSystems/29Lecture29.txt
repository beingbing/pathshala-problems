~~ threads - memory model ~~

how memory map of a process looks like when we introduce a thread inside it.

memory map of a process (discussed in a previous lecture)

in this we can see that for threads local variables must be separate, and they are stored in stack
space, hence stack space will definetly be segregated.

code                1KB         same for all the threads
                                                        
global data         1KB         same for all the threads

heap space          3KB (from 2KB till 5KB)         same for all the threads
    |   grows down

    |   grows up
stack space         1KB (from 15KB till 16KB)       different for each thread


stack space:    s1  s2  s3  ...
a different stack space for each thread.

also, a separate stack pointer and frame pointer for each thread. And as all these information
was contained by PCB, so we introduce one at thread level also, called as thread control block (TCB)
