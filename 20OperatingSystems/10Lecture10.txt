~~ shortest job first algorithm ~~

convoy effect failed the FIFO algorithm, instead lets choose shortest-job-first (SJF) algorithm.
the DS used in SJF will be priority_queue.

but still what if a big process comes in the beginning and occupies the CPU, convoy effect
can occur in this algorithm too.
here, we can wait for a little longer to see what new jobs comes next to decide which job to run
but it will increase the turn around time of already present job unnecessarily and CPU is sitting
idle even though a job is ready for getting executed.
instead we can go with pre-emption, in this a running job can be interrupted and removed to give
CPU time to another job.
