## 🔄 Thrashing – The Hidden Cost of Too Much Multiprogramming

### 💡 Basic Question:
Is it always a good idea to keep increasing the number of programs (threads/processes) running on a system?

### 🧠 Core Concept:
At first, increasing the **degree of multiprogramming** (number of processes in memory) improves **CPU utilization**. More processes mean more chances to keep the CPU busy.

But **beyond a certain point**, adding more processes leads to a **sharp decline in performance**. Why?

## 🔍 What Happens Beyond the Threshold?
As the number of processes increases:

1. **Page Faults Increase:**
   - Each process needs memory (pages).
   - When the system runs out of physical memory, it starts swapping pages in and out from disk frequently.
   - This leads to high **page fault rates**.

2. **More Time in Context Switching & Scheduling:**
   - Managing too many processes increases overhead.
   - CPU spends more time **switching between processes** instead of doing actual computation.

3. **Reduced CPU Utilization:**
   - The CPU ends up idle, waiting for memory operations (like disk I/O during paging) to complete.
   - This causes a **drop in overall system efficiency**.

## 📉 The Thrashing Effect
We can visualize the relationship like this:

- **Before the threshold:**
  ```
  ↑ Degree of Multiprogramming ⇒ ↑ CPU Utilization
  ```

- **After the threshold:**
  ```
  ↑ Degree of Multiprogramming ⇒ ↓ CPU Utilization
  ```

This sharp drop in performance due to excessive paging and overhead is called **Thrashing**.

> **Definition:**  
> Thrashing is a condition where the system spends more time **swapping pages** and managing processes than actually executing them.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Thrashing is not caused by high CPU usage but by **excessive memory contention**.
- It typically occurs in **virtual memory systems** when the **working sets** of all active processes cannot fit in physical memory.
- The **threshold** beyond which thrashing begins depends on:
  - Amount of available RAM
  - Size of the processes
  - Page replacement policy
  - Process behavior (I/O bound vs CPU bound)
