~~ thrashing ~~

is it a good idea to keep on increasing multi-threading upto an infinite level ?

if degree of multiprogramming increases beyond a certain level,

then a lot of page faults start happening,
and CPU will spend more time in them.

context switching / scheduling also take a lot of time.

so,
degree of multiprogramming ^
more time spent on -
- servicing page faults
- scheduling algorithm

hence utilization of CPU goes on reducing.

so, upto a threshold
degree of multiprogramming          is directly proportional to         CPU utilization

and, after a threshold
CPU utilization         is inversely proportional to        degree of multiprogramming

this idea of doing so much multiprogramming that you are just spending a lot of time
maintaining it and not doing any actual work is called thrashing.

this threshold depends on multiple factors.
