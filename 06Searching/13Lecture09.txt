~~ square root ~~

given a number n find it's square root, or floor of square root (if it's not a perfect square)

int low = 0, high = n;
while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
    if (mid * mid > n) high = mid - 1;
    else {
        if ((mid+1)*(mid+1) > n) return m;
        else low = mid + 1;
    }
}

TC = O(logn)
