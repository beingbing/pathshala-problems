~~ Common Observations ~~

1. the search space should be ordered according to some rules which helps us in deducing which
half to explore.

2. If we told to search for an element which is not actually present in search space, then, once
we are done with binary searching,
low = upper_bound (pointing towards element just smaller than key)
high = lower_bound (pointing towards element just higher than key)

so, if we asked to put the key in our search space, then it should come at the index pointed by
low.
but, if low do not exist then key will become our last element.
