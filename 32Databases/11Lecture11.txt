~~ types of indices ~~

- unordered map -> hash table

hash value is generated within a range for given keys, for which we used to store corresponding
keys

hash values might have pointer to different files at which all the list of keys with
same hask-key are present

- ordered map(balanced BST implemented under hood) -> B-tree which is extended to B+ tree

we will have a structure for the root that will point to different entries.

The tree can also be having 3 children at each node called ternary tree.

So, insertion and deletion is expensive with indexing.
