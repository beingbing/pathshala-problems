~~ types of indices ~~

Data structures used to create indices in databases can be categorized into two main types:
A. unordered map
    - hash table
        - Maps keys to values using a hash function.
        - Provides constant-time lookup in ideal scenarios.
        - Suitable for exact match queries within a limited set but not good for range queries
        or ordered retrieval.
        - hash values might have pointer to different files at which all the list of keys with
        same hash-key are present

    - bitmap index
    - inverted index

B. ordered map (called TreeMap in Java)
    - B-tree (balanced BST)
        -  Hierarchical structure with sorted keys and pointers to child nodes.

    - B+ tree (balanced BST with enhancements)
    - suffix tree/array

Note: introduction of any kind of indexing make insertion and deletion costlier.

Note: with indexing we are making a tradeoff between time and space. With having
an extra DS in memory we are trying to reduce the query time.
