# Database Maintainability: Federation
As a database grows—especially when handling data for **millions of users**—queries and operations can slow down. While basic **database software maintenance** comes built-in, **maintaining performance, reliability, and availability** becomes a challenge at scale.

## The Problem:
A single large database handling **all data (orders, products, users, etc.)** can:
* Become a bottleneck for query performance.
* Slow down as more data and users are added.
* Struggle to handle high concurrency.

## The Solution: Federation (Functional Partitioning)
Instead of one huge database, **Federation** divides data across multiple specialized databases, each responsible for a **specific function** or **domain**:
* One database for **user data**.
* Another for **orders**.
* One for **product details**, etc.

This approach **modularizes the system**, where each database server is optimized for its domain.

Federation splits a monolithic database into **functionally specialized modules**, improving **scalability** and **performance** for large systems. However, it introduces **infrastructure and application-level complexity** that must be carefully managed.

**Key Point:** Federation is typically considered when the system scales to around **10 million active users**, though exact thresholds vary based on workload and infrastructure.

### Advantages:
- **Easier to Maintain:** Bugs, upgrades, and schema changes are easier to manage within smaller, domain-specific databases.
- **Improved Performance:** Traffic is distributed across multiple databases, reducing load on any single server.
- **Scalability:**
  * **Horizontal scaling** (adding more servers) becomes easier, as each database can scale independently.
  * Reduces reliance on **vertical scaling** (adding power to a single server).

### Challenges:
- **Increased Infrastructure Complexity:** More servers and components require additional resources and monitoring.
- **Application Complexity:** The application layer must handle **which database** to query based on the requested data.
- **Cross-Database Joins:** Queries that need to join data from multiple domains become harder to implement efficiently.
