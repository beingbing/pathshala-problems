~~ database scalability : denormalisation ~~

scalability: maintain acceptable performance with increasing load.

techniques to ensure scalability -
- improving the performance
1. to actually go for the right DB which is more suitable for your use case
2. with SQL, denormalisation can be done
3. go for some kind of indexing.

if we can't improve performance then split the load
- Federation
- Scharding - splitting the same DB into multiple portions


Denomalisation -
Normal forms: we are able to create good DB designs

it states that, sometimes it is better to break normal form rules to get better performance.

we might need to keep a derived field so that our application do not choke while processing
a query if dataset is huge.
