~~ Database maintainability: Federation ~~

SRP: single responsibility principle

whenever it is violated, it might lead to issues and difficulty in maintainance, hence, 
the idea of Federation (functional responsibility) comes in -

in this, we even divide DB also in smaller modules instead of keeping one huge DB.
But, keep in mind that it should not be overdone.

we do Federation, once we reach around 10M users (approximately)

advantages -
 - easy to maintain, find bugs and upgrades.
 - reduction of traffic
 - increase in scalability
 - horizontal scalling high, vertical scalling low

disadvantages -
 - amount of hardware increases with that, the application side is more complex.
 - maintainability of application decreases
 - Joins queries is difficult across DB
