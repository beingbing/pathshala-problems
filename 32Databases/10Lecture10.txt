~~ database scalability: indexing ~~

we can create a mapping of that value with it's location in the table

problem -
- DB has persist memory, but map we are creating is in RAM, which will get lost once machine
is shut down.
- we may not have enough RAM to build that mapping.

This concept of having some kind of persist map even if the server shut down then this map
is called as an index and this process is called indexing.

types - 
- primary/clustered index
(given by DBMS itself)

- secondary/clustered index
(we need to create it on our own)

To show us the nearby taxi, uber creats its own index based on location.

build secondary indeices only when -
- identified frequent queries
- scaled to a substantial users

in DB,
ordered map is built using B-tree or B+ tree

unordered map is built using hashing based index
