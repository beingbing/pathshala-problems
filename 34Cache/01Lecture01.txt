~~ introduction to cache ~~

If we have calculated value for some case then store it then when someone else again ask
for the same information, do not do the calculation, just return it from the storage.
just like memoization.

cache: a simple s/w or h/w components that stores data for fast retrieval by avoiding
recomputation.
s/w example - map
h/w example - redis

cache hit: whenever a query comes, first check if it is present in cache, if it is then its a
cache hit.

cache miss: if you can not find the data in cache then its a cache miss.

we generally tries to keep cache hit rate higher.

cache hit rates depend on your system, some examples are -
1. recency bias
2. avg over a long period
