# 🚀 **Cache Positions in Web Architecture**
In a typical **three-tier system architecture** — frontend, backend, and database — caching can be implemented at different layers to **improve performance, reduce latency, and ease system load**.

## 🌐 **A. Presentation Tier (Frontend)**
* **Browser Cache**:
  * Stores static assets like images, JavaScript files, and stylesheets directly in the user's browser.
  * Reduces the need for repeated requests to the server for common resources.
  * Can also cache frequently accessed dynamic data (e.g., via `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`).
* **Note**:
  * In polling APIs, the browser cache might return outdated data if cached. To force the browser to always fetch fresh data from the server, set the **`Cache-Control: no-cache`** header in the request.
  * **Pull CDNs** (like AWS CloudFront) also act as cache layers at the network edge, caching frequently requested resources closer to the client.

## 🖥️ **B. Application Tier (Backend)**
* **API Response Caching**: Cache frequently requested API responses at the server to reduce backend processing and improve response times.
* **Session Management Caching**: Store session data (like user tokens or login states) in fast-access memory (e.g., Redis) to avoid repeated access to databases for session verification.
**Note**: Both **forward proxies** (client-side) and **reverse proxies** (server-side) can use caching to serve identical queries for multiple clients, reducing backend load.

## 🗄️ **C. Data Tier (Database)**
* **Query Result Caching**:
  * Cache frequently accessed database query results (e.g., user profiles, product listings) in memory.
  * Reduces database load and avoids repeated execution of complex queries.
