~~ what is a BST ~~

special kind of BT -> BST

Binary Search -> sortedness
Tree -> hierarchical (dynamic) DS -> insertion/deletion in runtime.

in a sorted array -
search - O(logn)
insertion/deletion - O(n)

in a sorted LL -
search - O(n)
insertion/deletion - O(n)

BST - everything in LST of root is smaller than root, and everything in RST is larger.
