~~ delete in BST ~~

given a BST and a number k, delete node whose value is equal to k, and return root of updated BST.

we have 3 scenarios -
- the node to be deleted is leaf node.
- the node to be deleted has only one child, replace it with its child.
- the node to be deleted has both children.

in third case we have 2 scenarios -
- replace it with the largest element of LST
- replace it with the smallest element of RST

methods needed to accomplish deletion -
- getNodeAndParent()
- isLeaf()
- deleteLeaf()
- hasSingleChild()
- deleteSingleChildNode()
- deleteDoubleChildNode()
- deleteRoot()
