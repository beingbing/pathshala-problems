~~ Count of Nodes in Complete Binary Tree - 1 ~~

cbt - all the levels are full, except the last level. last level can be allowed to be partially filled.
if partially full then all the nodes do appear as left as possible (there should not be any NULL node).

perfect binary tree - all levels are full.

Q. count number of nodes in a perfect binary tree.
A. 2^(h) - 1, h => height.      2^(i+1) - 1, i => level.

h = logn, n => no of nodes.
so,
TC becomes logh = loglogn.
