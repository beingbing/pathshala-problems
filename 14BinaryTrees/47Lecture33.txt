~~ reconstructing tree from preorder traversal ~~

although we have seen that only availability of preorder/postorder or availability of preorder and postorder
is not enough to construct a tree but can we make some modifications in the way we do preorder traversal
and then try to reconstruct tree with that.

so, can we reconstruct a tree from only by a preorder ?

1   2   3   7   4   5   6

for this we need information when to return, so for that if we introduce null nodes also our job will
be done.

1   2   3   N   7   N   N   N   4   5   N   N   6   N   N

these null nodes signifies us as when to return in our recursion call stack.

// to construct preorder array
void preorder(Node* root, vector<int> po) {
    if (!root) po.push_back(NULL), return;
    pre.push_back(root->val);
    preorder(root->left, po);
    preorder(root->right, po);
}

// to construct tree from preorder
Node* makeTree(vector<int>& po, int& i) {
    if (po[i] == NULL) i++, return NULL;
    Node* n = new Node(po[i], NULL, NULL);
    i++;
    n->left = makeTree(po, i);
    n->right = makeTree(po, i);
    return n;
}
TC = O(n)

Q. can this idea be extended to postorder and inorder traversal also ?
