~~ vertical order traversal 1 ~~

given a binary tree, perform vertical order traversal.

assume every tree node to be a point on 2d plane and consider root to have (0,0)
x denotes level on which root is present
y denotes the height of eash node from the root, going in decreasing order.

so, once we calculate x & y coordinates for each node, we can print their vertical order.

(0,0)
(1,-1) (1,1)
(2,-2) (2,0) (2,2)
.
.
.


sorting will be first done on the basis of y in ascending,
but if y is same then according to x in ascending.

TC = O(nlogn)
