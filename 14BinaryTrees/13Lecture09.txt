~~ diameter of binary tree - 1 ~~

given a binary tree, find it's diameter

diameter -> longest path between any two nodes

diameter will be some path that will be taking turn about a particular node

it is not necessary that diameter will pass through root.

diameter of a tree = max(diameter of LST, diameter of RST, ht of tree);

int getDia(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    return max(getDia(root->left), getDia(root->right), 1+getHt(root->left)+getHt(root->right));
}

TC = O(n^2)
SC = O(H)
