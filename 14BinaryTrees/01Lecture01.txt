~~ what are trees ~~

The need for tree type data structure rose from the need to store hierarchical data

trees has nodes and edges.

nodes are further divided as leaf nodes and non-leaf nodes.

children => direct descendents.

Tree can be described as an acyclic graph

graph is collection of edges and vertices(nodes).

A tree with N nodes will have N-1 edges

categories of trees -

rooted vs unrooted trees

if your edges are bidirectional (you can travel in both the direction along the edge) then you
have an unrooted trees because any node can function as node.
but,
you can only travel from one node to another along an edge in one direction only in rooted tree
hence, they have a single well-defined root.


skewed tree -
all the nodes are trying in a single straight line (just like linked-list)

binary tree -
a node can have maximum 2 children. 

level -> every descendent creates a level.

for a tree with minimum number of level will have maximum branching.

in a perfect binary tree, total number of nodes = 2^(i+1) - 1
the root to leaf length = i (level of a tree)
other way around,
if a tree has, total number of nodes = n,
then root to leaf length = logn (level of a tree)

total leaf nodes = 2^i (roughly half of the total nodes)
so, in a perfect binary tree, max number of nodes will be present at the last level

programatic representation of tree node -
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *left, *right;
}

every tree is made up of 3 components - root, left subtree, right subtree.

hierarchy always leads to decomposed which can easy be conquered latter, hence, tree DS
is inherently recursive in nature and can be solved mostly by divide and conquer.
