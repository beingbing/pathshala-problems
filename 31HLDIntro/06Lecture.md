## Maintainability

From a developer's perspective, system code should be maintainable. This involves making the
structure and code easy to understand and work with.

### Key Principles

1. **Simplicity**: A simple structure helps with debugging and maintenance.
2. **Clean Code**: Code should be clear and understandable.

### Rules for Maintainability

#### Simplicity

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuse code to avoid redundancy.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Focus on the current requirements rather than over-engineering for future extensibility.

#### Evolvability

- The system should allow for future extensions without significant refactoring.
- New features should be easy to add.

By following these principles, we ensure that the system remains easy to maintain and extend.
