~~ maintainability ~~

moving on to 3. point,

this is from a developers perspective (LLD), the system code should be maintainable in nature.
1. design should be simple - helps in debugging
2. code should be clean (understandable)

rules to achieve maintainability -

1. simplicity -
KISS: keep it simple stupid
DRY: don't repeat yourself
YAGNI: you aren't gonna need it - do not stess much over extensibility, just do the job
as simply as possible.

2. evolvablity -
designed system should not restrict any possible probable future extension.
new features can be added easily
