~~ reliability ~~

The system is reliable (gives valid response) in every situation.

scalability - system is able to manage x amount of requests together.

maintainability - system should be maintainable if new features need to be added.


reliability -
it focuses on that the application keeps running and gives the output no matter what happens.

the system should be fault tolerant.
no matter the fault, system is able to give corresponding responses.

fault - some type of error and issues that occur in a system.

fault -
1. hardware fault.
 - power going off.
 - connectivity loss.
 - hard dist / RAM failure.
due to this our requests start failing. To avoid this, make sure that there is no single
point of failure. (There are multiple servers) (like, load balancing, replication)

2. software fault.
 - code / configurational bugs or malfunctioning of application.
we need to handle exceptions/issues.
it will happen on every server copy, it will not be prevented by preventing single point of
failure.
for this, we need to keep testing our code.
We need to keep monitor our servers.
handle exceptions and errors gracefully (handle them, do not close down the server).
