~~ parallel threading - synchronized execution ~~

leetcode 1116

semaphore - special type of variables => to introduce synchronization in parallel threads
interprocess communication using semaphore

acquire() => put a lock on variable so that no one else can acquire it.
release() => release the lock.

Semaphore sem = new Semaphore(1) // 1 -> count of threads which can acquire it at a time

this will confirm synchronization but ordering is still not maintained
so, we need 3 semaphore

Semaphore sem_zero = new Semaphore(1)
Semaphore sem_odd = new Semaphore(1)
Semaphore sem_even = new Semaphore(1)

but here we want that zero will always be the first to acquire the lock, hence, 

Semaphore sem_zero = new Semaphore(1)
Semaphore sem_odd = new Semaphore(0)
Semaphore sem_even = new Semaphore(0)
