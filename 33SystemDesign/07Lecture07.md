# 🌐 **Forward and Reverse Proxies**
In modern backend architectures, a **Load Balancer (LB)** can also act as a **proxy server**, depending on system needs. Let’s break this down.

## 🔑 **What is a Proxy?**
A **proxy** acts on behalf of someone or something else.
In computing, a **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between a client (like a browser or app) and the internet.

There are **two main types of proxies** based on who they serve:

### 🔎 **1️⃣ Forward Proxy (for Clients)**
* Acts **on behalf of clients** (browsers, apps) to access internet resources.
* Sits **between the client and the internet**.
* Masks the client’s identity, adding **anonymity**.
* Commonly used for **content filtering, caching, and performance optimization**.

📚 **Example**:
In a school network, student browsers use a forward proxy to access the internet, filtering which websites they can access.

✅ **Advantages**:
* 🔒 Can block access to certain sites via a firewall.
* 🚀 Improves performance by caching frequently requested resources and serving them to multiple clients.
* 🛡️ Provides security by filtering malicious responses.
* 👤 Ensures client anonymity.

### 🔁 **2️⃣ Reverse Proxy (for Servers)**
* Acts **on behalf of backend servers** to handle incoming client requests.
* Sits **between the internet and application servers**.
* Shields backend servers from direct exposure, **hiding their identity and structure**.
* Can distribute traffic across multiple servers, acting as a **load balancer**.

📚 **Example**:
Nginx or HAProxy often function as reverse proxies in web applications.

✅ **Advantages**:
* 🛡️ Protects against **DDoS attacks** by filtering and rate-limiting requests.
* 🔑 Handles **SSL termination** (decrypting HTTPS) and manages cookies, sessions, etc. (acts as an **API Gateway**).
* 🚀 Caches server responses to speed up repeated requests.
* 📦 Can **compress** data to reduce bandwidth usage (e.g., gzip).

### 🔄 **Summary: How Do They Relate to Load Balancers?**
* A **Load Balancer (LB)** can perform the functions of a **reverse proxy**:
  * Distributing client requests across backend servers.
  * Managing sessions, caching, and security.
* In certain architectures, the **LB also combines roles** like acting as a **service discovery system**.

### 🏁 **Conclusion**
With this, we wrap up the **Maintainability** section of the backend server architecture.
Next, we’ll dive into **Scalability** – understanding how to design systems to handle growing demand and load.
