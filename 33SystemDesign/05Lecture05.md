# üîß **Backend Maintainability: From Monolith to Microservices**
When the codebase becomes large, splitting it into **smaller modules** (following the **Single Responsibility Principle - SRP**) helps at the design level. These modules can call each other to complete tasks. However, during deployment, these modules are often combined into a **single deployable unit**, running as a **monolithic architecture**.

## üö® **Challenges of a Monolith**
* **Deployment Complexity:** Even if you update a single module, you need to test the entire system since everything is bundled into one big codebase.
* **Configuration Headaches:** Changing configurations (like database connections or environment variables) for one module risks breaking others.
* **Error Diagnosis:** Errors, especially database issues, are hard to trace back to the specific module causing them.
* **Scaling Inefficiencies:** Scaling the monolith means scaling the entire system, which is expensive and wasteful when only some parts need more resources.

## üåê **The Microservices Approach**
The solution? If we already split the code into modules at the design level, **why not deploy them independently as well?**
* Each module (or group of modules) becomes a **microservice**, deployed separately.
* Microservices **communicate via APIs** (like REST) instead of function calls.
* Now, we can deploy, scale, and maintain each service independently.

## ‚úÖ **Advantages of Microservices**
1. **Flexible Deployment:** Only the modified microservice needs deployment and testing, not the entire system.
2. **Config Isolation:** Each service manages its own environment and settings.
3. **Easier Error Detection:** Errors are isolated to specific services, simplifying debugging.
4. **Cost-Effective Scaling:** Only the services under heavy load need more resources, reducing costs.
5. **Tech Flexibility:** Individual services can be rewritten in different languages or frameworks without affecting the system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges with Microservices**
1. **Proper Splitting:** Poorly defined boundaries can lead to frequent cross-service calls, increasing latency and complexity.
2. **Service Discovery:** Unlike monoliths where modules communicate internally, microservices must locate each other via IPs or hostnames.
   üîç Common **service discovery tools** include **Zookeeper, Apache Curator, NGINX**, and built-in solutions in **AWS Cloud**.
