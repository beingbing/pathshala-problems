~~ backend reliablity: REST APIs ~~

assume backend is a single machine which the front-end calls for different queries and it
respond by quering the DB.

Front-end query using APIs (functions) exposed by the backend

Reliability -

Single point of failure -
we can use replication

Note: backend should never have a state to maintain. Backend should only depend upon the
query from client and upon the DB for query resolution.

If a client has some actions performed which brings a need for state then the results
of clients actions should be stored in DB.
So,
our backend should be stateless in nature and clients state should be kept in DB as a
mapping in a table.

So, the kind of APIs which are stateless in nature are called REST (Representational 
State Transfer) APIs

clients should not know about the presence of different replicas of backend, to ensure that
we keep another level of abstraction by introducing load balancer
