~~ service discovery ~~

1. let us keep in each machines configuration files the location of other machines.
issues -
- what if a machines IP address changes, due to which all machines need to be updated
- if we have replicas in a microservices and has a load balancer, then config of 
other microservices again needs to change

2. use separate discovery server, which will maintain a service registry.
every microservice subscribe to discovery service and logs its location and same for
if any load balancer is present.
then all microservices will contact discovery service to know where to contact.

types -
1. client side service discovery
a microservice calls discovery server, it maintains a map and respond with the location.
and a new incoming microservice will subscribe to discovery server and create a logs
for its location.

disadvantage -
- requesting microservice needs to make two calls
- needs to have logic to get the address and then use it to contact another microservice
- 

2. server side service discovery
when a microservice contacts discovery server for details of whom to contact, discovery server
will contact the other microservice on it's behalf and respond to it with the response
discovery server gets on its behalf.

disadvantage -
- slower
- single point of failure will stop internal microservice communication


In some architectures LB acts as discovery server as well.
