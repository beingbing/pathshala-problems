~~ detecting odd one out ~~

1. given an integer array, every element comes twice, except just one element, find that element out.

ans: take XOR of all array elements, that xor will be your answer

2. given an integer array, every element comes even times, except just one element, find that element out.

ans: same as above

3. every elements appears thrice except 1 element which is coming only once, find that element.

ans:

code -
int singleNum(vector<int>& a) {
    long mask = 1L << 31, ans = 0
    for (i{31}; i>=0; i--) {
        int cnt = 0
        for (j{0}; j<a.size(); j++) if (a[j] & mask) cnt++
        if (cnt%3 != 0) ans += mask
        mask >>= 1
    }
    return ans;
}
