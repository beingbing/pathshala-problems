~~ find two elements ~~

given array of n elements, every element comes twice, just two elements comes once.
find those two elements.

if we take XOR of complete array, then we will have XOR of n1 and n2 as well.
in that, we can take first set bit, and with its help divide the array into two
halves.
one half with all numbers whose that selected bit is set.
other half with all numbers whose that bit is unset.
then take XOR of those groups separately, there XOR will be our numbers n1 and n2.

findNums(vector<int>& a) {
    int overallXOR = 0
    for (auto ele : a) overallXOR ^= ele;
    int leastSetBit = 1;
    while (!(leastSetBit & overallXOR)) leastSetBit << 1;
    n1 = 0
    for (auto ele : a) if (ele & leastSetBit) n1 ^= ele;
    n2 = overallXOR ^ n1;
    return {n1, n2};
}

TC = O(n)
