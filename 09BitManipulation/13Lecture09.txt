~~ finding minimum XOR ~~

given array, find min(a[i]^a[j]), where i != j and 0 <= i < j < n

adjacent elements in a sorted array may have the smallest array
we reached to this solution by using mathematical exptrapolation approach where
you take a smaller set of cases find the possible answer candidates, find a relation
among them which might be responsible for answer and then extrapolate your hypothesis
on a bigger set. if found true you have algorithm which can lead to your answer.
