~~ bitwise operators - 2 ~~

4. left shift operator (<<)
- add 0 at right most bit and shift all present bits towards left
- whenever we left shift a number, we multiply it by 2

Note: bit operations are fastest

precedence order
ยง. arithematic operators
-. bitwise operators
hence, always put bracket around bitwise operator operands when put in an expression along with arithmetic operators.

5. right shift operator (>>)
- all bits move towards right and the left most bit is eliminated
- whenever we left shift a number, we divide it by 2
