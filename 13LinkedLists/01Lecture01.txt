~~ what is a linked list ~~

talking about difference between array(static/dynamic) and linked list.

describing how linked list is constructed (from logical understanding to implementation) -
class Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int x) {
        this.data = x;
        this.next = NULL;
    }
}

reading data from user and creating a linked list out of it -
Node* head = NULL;
Node* tail = NULL;

Node* tmp;

while(n--) {
    cin >> x;
    Node* tmp = new Node(x);
    if (!head) {
        head = tmp;
        tail = tmp;
    } else {
        tail->next = tmp;
        tail = tail->next;
    }
}


traversal -
Node* p = head;
while (p) {
    cout << p->data
    p = p->next;
}
