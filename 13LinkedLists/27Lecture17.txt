~~ flatten a linked list ~~

given a linked list. down => pointing to head of another linked list.

struct Node {
    int val;
    Node* next, down;
}

flatten this type of linked list.

we can have two approaches -
- through all the content of down pointer at the end of current pointer and update the tail pointer
- accomodate it in between cur and cur->next pointer.
